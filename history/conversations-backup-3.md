**Euthyphro:** Why did you leave the Lyceum, Socrates? And why are you here at the Porch of the King Archon? Are you involved in a legal case like me?

**Socrates:** Not a legal case, Euthyphro; the Athenians call it an impeachment.

**Euthyphro:** What! I suppose someone is prosecuting you, because I can't believe you're prosecuting someone else.

**Socrates:** Definitely not.

**Euthyphro:** So someone else is prosecuting you?

**Socrates:** Yes.

**Euthyphro:** Who is it?

**Socrates:** A young man named Meletus, from the deme of Pitthis. You might remember him; he has a beak-like nose, long straight hair, and a scruffy beard.

**Euthyphro:** No, I don't remember him. But what's the charge against you?

**Socrates:** It's a serious charge. He claims to know how the youth are corrupted and who corrupts them. He thinks he's wise and has found me out as a corrupter of the youth. The state will judge this.

**Euthyphro:** I hope he succeeds, but I fear he's attacking the foundation of the state. How does he say you corrupt the young?

**Socrates:** He accuses me of inventing new gods and denying the old ones. That's his charge.

**Euthyphro:** I see, he means to accuse you of introducing new religious ideas. He thinks you're a neologian and will take you to court for it. People easily believe such accusations. When I talk about divine things, they laugh at me and think I'm crazy, even though I'm telling the truth. They're jealous of us, but we must be brave.

**Socrates:** Their laughter doesn't matter much. People don't mind if someone is wise until they start sharing their wisdom. Then they get angry, maybe out of jealousy.

**Euthyphro:** I'm not likely to test their patience this way.

**Socrates:** Probably not, because you're reserved and don't share your wisdom often. But I like to share my thoughts with everyone, and I'm afraid the Athenians might think I'm too talkative. If they just laughed at me, it would be fine, but they might be serious, and only you soothsayers can predict the outcome.

**Euthyphro:** I think it will end in nothing, Socrates, and you'll win your case. I think I'll win mine too.

**Socrates:** What's your case, Euthyphro? Are you the prosecutor or the defendant?

**Euthyphro:** I'm the prosecutor.

**Socrates:** Who are you prosecuting?

**Euthyphro:** You'll think I'm crazy when I tell you.

**Socrates:** Why, is the person a fugitive?

**Euthyphro:** No, he's not very mobile at his age.

**Socrates:** Who is he?

**Euthyphro:** My father.

**Socrates:** Your father! Really?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** What's he accused of?

**Euthyphro:** Murder, Socrates.

**Socrates:** Wow, Euthyphro! People don't understand right and wrong very well. It takes a wise person to bring such a case.

**Euthyphro:** Indeed, Socrates, it does.

**Socrates:** I suppose the person your father killed was a relative?

**Euthyphro:** I'm amused that you distinguish between relatives and non-relatives. The pollution is the same if you associate with a murderer. The real question is whether the killing was just. If it was, leave it alone; if not, prosecute, even if the murderer is a family member. The man who died was a poor worker on our farm. He killed one of our servants in a drunken rage. My father tied him up and threw him in a ditch, then sent to Athens for advice. Meanwhile, he didn't care for him, thinking no harm would come if he died. The man died from cold and hunger before the messenger returned. My family is angry with me for prosecuting my father, saying it's impious. They don't understand what the gods think about piety and impiety.

**Socrates:** Good heavens, Euthyphro! Are you so sure about what's pious and impious that you're not afraid you might be doing something impious by prosecuting your father?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, Socrates, I have exact knowledge of these matters. What good would I be without it?

**Socrates:** My friend, I think I should become your disciple. Before my trial with Meletus, I'll tell him I've become your disciple to learn about religious matters.

**Socrates:** Meletus, I'll tell him that you acknowledge Euthyphro as a great theologian with sound opinions. If you approve of him, you should approve of me and not take me to court. But if you disapprove, you should start by indicting him, my teacher, who will ruin not the young but the old, like me and his own father. If Meletus doesn't listen and continues to indict me, I'll repeat this challenge in court.

**Euthyphro:** Yes, Socrates, and if he tries to indict me, I'll find a flaw in him. The court will have more to say to him than to me.

**Socrates:** Knowing this, I want to become your disciple. No one seems to notice you, not even Meletus, but he has quickly indicted me for impiety. So, please tell me what piety and impiety are, which you said you know well, and about murder and other offenses against the gods. Isn't piety always the same in every action? And isn't impiety always the opposite of piety, having one notion that includes everything impious?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, Socrates.

**Socrates:** What is piety, and what is impiety?

**Euthyphro:** Piety is doing what I'm doing—prosecuting anyone guilty of murder, sacrilege, or similar crimes, whether they are your father, mother, or anyone else. Not prosecuting them is impiety. Consider this proof: people regard Zeus as the best and most righteous of the gods, yet they admit he bound his father Cronos for devouring his sons and punished his own father Uranus for similar reasons. But when I proceed against my father, they get angry with me. They are inconsistent when it comes to the gods and me.

**Socrates:** Maybe this is why I'm charged with impiety—because I can't accept these stories about the gods. People think I'm wrong, but since you approve of them, I must agree with your superior wisdom. What else can I say, admitting I know nothing about them? Tell me, for the love of Zeus, do you really believe these stories are true?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, Socrates, and even more wonderful things that the world doesn't know.

**Socrates:** Do you really believe the gods fought and had quarrels and battles, as the poets say and as depicted in art? The temples are full of these stories, like the robe of Athene at the Panathenaea. Are these tales true, Euthyphro?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, Socrates, and I can tell you many other amazing things about the gods if you want to hear them.

**Socrates:** I'm sure you can, and you can tell me another time. But right now, I want a precise answer to what piety is. When asked, you only said it was prosecuting your father for murder.

**Euthyphro:** And what I said was true, Socrates.

**Socrates:** No doubt, Euthyphro, but there are many other pious acts, right?

**Euthyphro:** There are.

**Socrates:** I didn't ask for examples of piety but for the general idea that makes all pious things pious. Do you remember that there was one idea that made the impious impious and the pious pious?

**Euthyphro:** I remember.

**Socrates:** Tell me the nature of this idea, so I can have a standard to measure actions, whether yours or anyone else's, and say that such an action is pious and another impious.

**Euthyphro:** I'll tell you if you like.

**Socrates:** I would very much like that.

**Euthyphro:** Piety is what is dear to the gods, and impiety is what is not dear to them.

**Socrates:** Very good, Euthyphro. You've given me the answer I wanted. But whether it's true or not, I can't tell yet, although I'm sure you'll prove it.

**Euthyphro:** Of course.

**Socrates:** Let's examine what we're saying. What is dear to the gods is pious, and what is hateful to the gods is impious. These are opposites, right?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, that's what was said.

**Socrates:** And well said?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, Socrates, I thought so.

**Socrates:** And the gods were admitted to have enmities, hatreds, and differences?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, that was also said.

**Socrates:** What sort of differences create enmity and anger? If you and I differ about a number, do we become enemies? Don't we resolve it with arithmetic?

**Euthyphro:** True.

**Socrates:** Or if we differ about magnitudes, don't we resolve it by measuring?

**Euthyphro:** Very true.

**Socrates:** And we resolve differences about heavy and light by weighing?

**Euthyphro:** To be sure.

**Socrates:** But what differences can't be resolved this way and make us angry and enemies? These enmities arise when the differences are about just and unjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable. Aren't these the points about which we quarrel?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, Socrates, that's the nature of our quarrels.

**Socrates:** And the quarrels of the gods are of a similar nature?

**Euthyphro:** Certainly.

**Socrates:** They have differences of opinion about good and evil, just and unjust, honorable and dishonorable. There would be no quarrels if there were no such differences, right?

**Euthyphro:** You are quite right.

**Socrates:** Doesn't everyone love what they deem noble, just, and good, and hate the opposite?

**Euthyphro:** Very true.

**Socrates:** But people regard the same things differently, some as just and others as unjust, and this leads to disputes, wars, and fights.

**Euthyphro:** Very true.

**Socrates:** So, the same things are both hated and loved by the gods, making them both hateful and dear?

**Euthyphro:** True.

**Socrates:** This means the same things can be both pious and impious?

**Euthyphro:** I suppose so.

**Socrates:** Then you haven't answered my question. I didn't ask what is both pious and impious. It seems what is loved by the gods is also hated by them. So, in punishing your father, you might be pleasing Zeus but displeasing Cronos or Uranus, and pleasing Hephaestus but displeasing Hera. Other gods might also disagree.

**Euthyphro:** But I believe all the gods agree that a murderer should be punished. There would be no disagreement about that.

**Socrates:** Speaking of humans, have you ever heard anyone argue that a murderer or any wrongdoer should be let off?

**Euthyphro:** They argue about these things all the time, especially in courts. They commit crimes and will say anything to defend themselves.

**Socrates:** But do they admit their guilt and still say they shouldn't be punished?

**Euthyphro:** No, they don't.

**Socrates:** So, they don't argue that the guilty should go unpunished; they deny their guilt, right?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** So, they argue about who the wrongdoer is and what they did, not whether wrongdoers should be punished?

**Euthyphro:** True.

**Socrates:** And the gods are the same. They argue about what is just and unjust, not whether wrongdoers should be punished. Neither gods nor humans would say that wrongdoers shouldn't be punished.

**Euthyphro:** That's true, Socrates.

**Socrates:** But they argue about the specifics—gods and humans alike. They dispute whether an act is just or unjust.

**Euthyphro:** Quite true.

**Socrates:** So, tell me, Euthyphro, how do you know that all the gods agree that a servant who is guilty of murder and dies in chains before his master can learn what to do with him, dies unjustly? And that a son should prosecute his father for such an act? Prove to me that all the gods agree, and I'll applaud your wisdom forever.

**Euthyphro:** It will be difficult, but I could make it clear to you.

**Socrates:** I understand; you mean I'm not as quick as the judges. You'll prove to them that the act is unjust and hateful to the gods.

**Euthyphro:** Yes, Socrates, if they listen to me.

**Socrates:** They'll listen if you're a good speaker. But even if you prove that all the gods regard the death as unjust, how do I know more about piety and impiety? If an action is hateful to the gods, it doesn't define piety and impiety, because what's hateful to the gods can also be pleasing to them. So, I don't ask you to prove this. I'll assume all the gods condemn such an action. But let's amend the definition: what all the gods hate is impious, and what they love is pious or holy. What some love and others hate is both or neither. Shall this be our definition?

**Euthyphro:** Why not, Socrates?

**Socrates:** Why not! There's no reason why not. But will this help you instruct me as you promised?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, what all the gods love is pious and holy, and what they all hate is impious.

**Socrates:** Should we investigate this, or just accept it on our authority and others'?

**Euthyphro:** We should investigate, and I believe it will stand the test.

**Socrates:** We'll know better soon. First, I want to understand if the pious is loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?

**Euthyphro:** I don't understand.

**Socrates:** I'll explain: we talk about carrying and being carried, leading and being led, seeing and being seen. There's a difference in all these cases, right?

**Euthyphro:** I think I understand.

**Socrates:** Isn't what is loved different from what loves?

**Euthyphro:** Certainly.

**Socrates:** Is something carried because it is in the state of being carried, or for some other reason?

**Euthyphro:** No, that's the reason.

**Socrates:** The same is true of what is led and seen?

**Euthyphro:** True.

**Socrates:** A thing is not seen because it is visible, but visible because it is seen. A thing is not led because it is in the state of being led, or carried because it is in the state of being carried, but the opposite. My meaning is that any state of action or passion implies previous action or passion. It doesn't become because it is becoming, but it is in a state of becoming because it becomes. It doesn't suffer because it is in a state of suffering, but it is in a state of suffering because it suffers. Do you agree?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** Isn't what is loved in a state of becoming or suffering?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** The state of being loved follows the act of being loved, not the other way around.

**Euthyphro:** Certainly.

**Socrates:** What about piety, Euthyphro? Isn't piety, according to your definition, loved by all the gods?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** Because it is pious or holy, or for some other reason?

**Euthyphro:** No, that's the reason.

**Socrates:** It is loved because it is holy, not holy because it is loved?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** What is dear to the gods is loved by them because it is loved by them?

**Euthyphro:** Certainly.

**Socrates:** Then what is dear to the gods is not holy, nor is what is holy loved by the gods, as you affirm; they are two different things.

**Euthyphro:** What do you mean, Socrates?

**Socrates:** I mean that we agreed that something is holy because it is loved by the gods, not loved because it is holy.

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** But something is dear to the gods because they love it, not loved because it is dear to them.

**Euthyphro:** True.

**Socrates:** So, if what is holy is the same as what is dear to the gods, and is loved because it is holy, then what is dear to the gods would be loved because it is dear to them. But if what is dear to the gods is dear because they love it, then what is holy would be holy because they love it. But they are different. One is loved because it is loved, and the other is loved because it is of a kind to be loved. So, when I ask you what holiness is, you only tell me it is loved by the gods, not what it really is. Please tell me again what holiness or piety really is, whether the gods love it or not. And what is impiety?

**Euthyphro:** I don't know how to express what I mean. Our arguments seem to go in circles.

**Socrates:** Your words are like the work of my ancestor Daedalus; if I were the one saying them, you might say my arguments move around because I'm his descendant. But since these are your ideas, you must find another explanation, as they seem to move around.

**Euthyphro:** No, Socrates, you are the one who makes arguments move, not me. They wouldn't have moved if it were up to me.

**Socrates:** Then I must be greater than Daedalus, as I make others' arguments move too. But I'd rather not. I'd give anything to keep them fixed. But enough of this. Since you seem reluctant, I'll try to show you how you might teach me about piety. I hope you won't mind. Tell me, isn't what is pious necessarily just?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** And is everything that is just also pious, or is what is pious just, but not everything just is pious?

**Euthyphro:** I don't understand you, Socrates.

**Socrates:** I know you are wiser than I am, but your wisdom makes you lazy. Please try to understand. I'll explain with an example. The poet Stasinus says, "Where there is fear, there is also reverence." I disagree. Shall I tell you why?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, please.

**Socrates:** Many people fear poverty and disease, but they don't revere them.

**Euthyphro:** Very true.

**Socrates:** But where there is reverence, there is fear. Someone who feels reverence and shame about doing something fears a bad reputation.

**Euthyphro:** No doubt.

**Socrates:** So, we were wrong to say where there is fear, there is also reverence. We should say where there is reverence, there is also fear. But not always reverence where there is fear. Fear is broader, and reverence is a part of fear, like the odd is a part of number. Do you follow?

**Euthyphro:** Quite well.

**Socrates:** That's the question I meant to raise when I asked if the just is always pious, or the pious always just. There may be justice without piety, as justice is broader, and piety is a part of it. Do you agree?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, I think you are right.

**Socrates:** Then, if piety is a part of justice, we should ask what part. If you had asked me what an even number is, I would say it is a number with two equal sides. Do you agree?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, I agree.

**Socrates:** Similarly, tell me what part of justice is piety, so I can tell Meletus not to indict me for impiety, as I will be instructed by you in the nature of piety and its opposites.

**Euthyphro:** Piety or holiness, Socrates, seems to me to be the part of justice that attends to the gods, while the other part attends to men.

**Socrates:** That's good, Euthyphro. But I need more information. What do you mean by "attention"? Attention can't mean the same when applied to gods as to other things. For example, horses need attention, but only a skilled horseman can attend to them. Is that right?

**Euthyphro:** Certainly.

**Socrates:** The art of horsemanship is the art of attending to horses?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** Not everyone can attend to dogs, but only the huntsman?

**Euthyphro:** True.

**Socrates:** The art of the huntsman is the art of attending to dogs?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** And the art of the oxherd is the art of attending to oxen?

**Euthyphro:** Very true.

**Socrates:** So, holiness or piety is the art of attending to the gods?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** And isn't attention always for the good or benefit of what is attended to? Horses benefit from the horseman's art, right?

**Euthyphro:** True.

**Socrates:** Dogs benefit from the huntsman's art, and oxen from the oxherd's art. All things are attended for their good, not harm?

**Euthyphro:** Certainly, not for their harm.

**Socrates:** But for their good?

**Euthyphro:** Of course.

**Socrates:** So, does piety or holiness, which is the art of attending to the gods, benefit or improve them? When you do a holy act, do you make any of the gods better?

**Euthyphro:** No, no; that's not what I meant.

**Socrates:** And I never thought you did. I asked about the nature of attention because I thought you didn't mean that.

**Euthyphro:** You’re right, Socrates; that’s not the kind of attention I mean.

**Socrates:** Good. But I still need to know what kind of attention to the gods you mean by piety.

**Euthyphro:** It’s like the service that servants give to their masters.

**Socrates:** I see, a kind of service to the gods.

**Euthyphro:** Exactly.

**Socrates:** Medicine is also a kind of service, aiming to achieve health, right?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** And there’s an art that serves the shipbuilder to build a ship?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, Socrates.

**Socrates:** And an art that serves the housebuilder to build a house?

**Euthyphro:** Yes.

**Socrates:** So, tell me, what does the art that serves the gods help to accomplish? You must know if you’re the best in religious matters.

**Euthyphro:** I do know, Socrates.

**Socrates:** Then tell me, what great work do the gods accomplish with our help?

**Euthyphro:** The gods do many great things, Socrates.

**Socrates:** Yes, but what is their main work? For example, a general’s main work is victory in war, right?

**Euthyphro:** Certainly.

**Socrates:** And a farmer’s main work is producing food from the earth?

**Euthyphro:** Exactly.

**Socrates:** So, what is the main work of the gods?

**Euthyphro:** I’ve already told you, Socrates, that learning all these things accurately is tiresome. Piety is knowing how to please the gods with prayers and sacrifices. This piety saves families and states, while impiety, which displeases the gods, ruins them.

**Socrates:** You could have answered my main question in fewer words, Euthyphro. But I see you don’t want to teach me. Otherwise, you would have answered directly. Now, I must ask again, what is piety? Do you mean it’s a kind of science of praying and sacrificing?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, I do.

**Socrates:** And sacrificing is giving to the gods, and praying is asking from the gods?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, Socrates.

**Socrates:** So, piety is a science of asking and giving?

**Euthyphro:** You understand me well, Socrates.

**Socrates:** Yes, because I focus on your teachings. Please tell me, what is the nature of this service to the gods? Do you mean we make requests and give gifts to them?

**Euthyphro:** Yes, I do.

**Socrates:** Isn’t the right way of asking to ask for what we want?

**Euthyphro:** Certainly.

**Socrates:** And the right way of giving is to give them what they want from us. There’s no point in giving something they don’t want.

**Euthyphro:** Very true, Socrates.

**Socrates:** So, piety is a kind of business between gods and men?

**Euthyphro:** You could say that.

**Socrates:** But I care only about the truth. What benefit do the gods get from our gifts? They give us everything good, but how do we give anything good to them? If they give everything and we give nothing, we have the advantage.

**Euthyphro:** Do you think the gods benefit from our gifts, Socrates?

**Socrates:** If not, what’s the point of our gifts to the gods?

**Euthyphro:** They are tributes of honor and what pleases them.

**Socrates:** So, piety is pleasing to the gods but not beneficial to them?

**Euthyphro:** I’d say nothing could be dearer to them.

**Socrates:** So, piety is dear to the gods?

**Euthyphro:** Certainly.

**Socrates:** And can you wonder why your words don’t stay fixed but move around? You accuse me of making them move, but it’s you who make them go in circles. We said that piety is not the same as what is loved by the gods. Have you forgotten?

**Euthyphro:** I remember.

**Socrates:** And now you say what is loved by the gods is holy, which is the same as what is dear to them. Do you see?

**Euthyphro:** True.

**Socrates:** Then either we were wrong before, or we are wrong now.

**Euthyphro:** One of the two must be true.

**Socrates:** Then we must start again and ask, what is piety? I will never tire of this question. Please, don’t scorn me but tell me the truth. If anyone knows, it’s you. I must hold you until you tell me. If you didn’t know the nature of piety and impiety, you wouldn’t have charged your father with murder. You wouldn’t risk doing wrong in the sight of the gods and would respect human opinions. So, you must know the nature of piety and impiety. Speak out, Euthyphro, and don’t hide your knowledge.

**Euthyphro:** Another time, Socrates; I’m in a hurry and must go now.

**Socrates:** Alas! Will you leave me in despair? I hoped you would teach me about piety and impiety, so I could defend myself against Meletus. I would have told him I was enlightened by Euthyphro and had given up my ignorant ways to lead a better life.
