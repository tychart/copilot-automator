Sent by Copilot: Sure, I can help with that! Here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of Aristotle's text in modern language:

**Chapter I:**

1. Human excellence is of two types: intellectual and moral.
2. Intellectual excellence comes from teaching and requires experience and time.
3. Moral excellence comes from habit, which is why the Greek word for it is related to the word for habit.
4. Moral virtues are not in us by nature because natural things can't be changed by habit.
5. For example, a stone naturally falls down and can't be trained to go up.
6. Virtues are not in us by nature, but we have the capacity to develop them through habit.
7. We first have the ability to do things by nature, and then we perform the actions.
8. For example, we have senses like sight and hearing before we use them.
9. But we develop virtues by first doing actions, like learning to build by building.
10. By doing just actions, we become just; by doing brave actions, we become brave.
11. Lawmakers make people good by habituation, which is the goal of laws.
12. Virtues are created or destroyed by the same actions, like playing the harp well or poorly.
13. By acting in certain ways, we become just or unjust, brave or cowardly.
14. Habits are formed by actions, so we must act in certain ways to develop good habits.
15. Whether we are trained well or poorly from childhood makes a big difference.

**Chapter II:**

1. The goal of this treatise is not just to know what virtue is, but to become virtuous.
2. We must consider how to perform actions because habits depend on them.
3. Acting according to right reason is a general rule, which we will discuss later.
4. Moral actions can't be described exactly because they vary like matters of health.
5. Exactness is not possible in particular cases; individuals must judge each situation.
6. Things are spoiled by excess and deficiency, like health and strength.
7. Too much or too little training, food, or drink can harm health.
8. The same applies to virtues like self-mastery and courage.
9. Excessive fear makes one a coward; no fear makes one rash.
10. Indulging in every pleasure leads to lack of self-control; avoiding all pleasures makes one dull.
11. Virtues are preserved by the mean state, not by excess or deficiency.
12. Habits are formed and maintained by the same actions.
13. Strength comes from eating well and exercising, and the strong can do these best.
14. Similarly, by abstaining from pleasures, we develop self-mastery.
15. By facing fears, we become brave, and the brave can best face fears.

**Chapter II (continued):**

1. To test if habits are formed, we should look at the pleasure or pain that follows actions.
2. A person with self-mastery not only avoids bodily pleasures but is happy to do so.
3. Someone who avoids pleasures but is unhappy about it does not have self-mastery.
4. A brave person faces danger with pleasure or at least without pain.
5. Someone who faces danger with pain is not truly brave.
6. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains because we do bad things for pleasure and avoid doing right things because of pain.
7. Plato said that people should be trained from childhood to feel pleasure and pain from the right things, which is proper education.
8. Virtues involve actions and feelings, and every action and feeling is followed by pleasure or pain.

11. Every habit of the soul is related to things that can improve or worsen it, like pleasures and pains.
12. Habits become bad when people pursue or avoid pleasures and pains in the wrong way, at the wrong time, or in the wrong manner.
13. Some people wrongly define virtues as states of being unaffected by anything, but they should add "as they ought" or "as they ought not."
14. Virtue is the habit that deals with pleasures and pains in the best way, while vice is the opposite.
15. Three things move us to choose or avoid: the honorable, the useful, and the pleasant, and their opposites: the dishonorable, the harmful, and the painful.

21. Heraclitus said it's harder to fight against pleasure than anger.
22. Art and virtue come into being because they deal with difficult things.
23. Virtue and moral philosophy focus on pleasures and pains because using them well makes a person good, and using them poorly makes a person bad.
24. Virtue deals with pleasures and pains and is increased or ruined by the same circumstances that created it.

**Chapter III:**

1. Some might be confused by the idea that we must do just actions to become just and self-mastery actions to gain self-mastery.
2. They might think that if we do these actions, we already have the virtues, like being a grammarian or musician by doing their actions.
3. But in arts, a person might do something grammatical by chance or suggestion, not by their own knowledge.
4. A person is a grammarian when they produce grammatical work by their own knowledge.
5. Arts and virtues are different because arts produce things with excellence in themselves.
6. Virtues produce actions of a certain kind, like justice or self-mastery, not just by being in a certain state but by the person being in a certain state.
7. For virtues, knowledge alone is not enough; the person must also act with deliberate preference and stability.
8. Virtues come from repeatedly doing just and self-mastery actions.
9. Actions are called by the names of these habits when they are like what a just or self-mastering person would do.
10. A person is not virtuous just by doing these actions but by doing them as a just or self-mastering person would.
11. Virtues are formed by doing the actions, but not doing them means not becoming a good person.
12. Many people talk about virtues but don't practice them, like sick people who listen to a doctor but don't follow the advice.
13. Just as these people can't get well physically, those who only talk about virtues can't become good mentally.

**Chapter IV:**

1. Next, we need to examine what virtue is.
2. Things in the mind are of three kinds: feelings, capacities, and states.
3. Virtue must belong to one of these three classes.
4. Feelings include things like lust, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, friendship, hatred, longing, emulation, and compassion.
5. Capacities are what make us capable of these feelings, like being able to get angry or feel compassion.
6. States are how we relate to these feelings, like being too violent or too slack in anger.
7. Being in the right state means having the right relation to these feelings.

Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the provided text in modern language:

**Chapter VIII:**

1. There are three states in each case: two faulty (excess and defect) and one right (the mean).
2. These states are opposed to each other: the extremes oppose the mean and each other.
3. For example, the brave man seems rash to the coward and cowardly to the rash person.
4. Similarly, the self-controlled person seems indulgent to the insensible and insensible to the indulgent.
5. The liberal person seems prodigal to the stingy and stingy to the prodigal.
6. Extreme characters push the person in the mean state towards each other.
7. The brave person is called rash by the coward and cowardly by the rash person.
8. The opposition between extremes is greater than between either extreme and the mean.
9. Some extremes resemble the mean, like rashness to courage and prodigality to liberality.
10. The greatest dissimilarity is between the extremes.
11. The further things are from each other, the more contrary they are.
12. Sometimes the excess is more opposed to the mean, and sometimes the defect is.
13. For courage, cowardice (the defect) is more opposed than rashness (the excess).
14. For self-mastery, lack of self-control (the excess) is more opposed than insensibility (the defect).
15. This is because one extreme is closer to the mean and resembles it more.
16. We have a natural bias towards pleasures, making us more inclined to lack self-control.
17. Therefore, lack of self-control is more contrary to self-mastery than insensibility.

**Chapter IX:**

2. It aims at the mean in feelings and actions.
3. It's hard to be good because finding the mean is difficult.

5. Goodness is rare, praiseworthy, and noble.
6. To aim at the mean, avoid the extreme that is more contrary to it.
7. Like Ulysses avoiding danger, steer clear of the worse extreme.
8. Since hitting the mean exactly is difficult, choose the lesser evil.
9. Consider your natural bias, which varies for each person.
10. Force yourself in the opposite direction to find the mean.
11. Guard against pleasure because we are not impartial judges of it.
12. Treat pleasure like the old counselors treated Helen, avoiding it to err less.
