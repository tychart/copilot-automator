Sent by Copilot: Sure, I'll break down Aristotle's text into simpler, modern language for you:

### Chapter I

1. Human excellence is of two kinds: intellectual and moral.
2. Intellectual excellence comes from teaching and requires experience and time.
3. Moral excellence comes from habit, which is why the Greek word for it is related to the word for habit.
4. Moral virtues are not in us by nature because things that exist by nature can't be changed by habit.
5. For example, a stone naturally falls down and can't be trained to go up, no matter how many times you throw it.
6. Virtues are not in us by nature, but we have the capacity to develop them through habit.
7. We first have the ability to do things by nature, and then we perform the actions.
8. For example, we have senses like sight and hearing before we use them, not because we use them.
9. But we get virtues by first doing actions, like learning to build by building or playing the harp by playing it.
10. By doing just actions, we become just; by doing self-controlled actions, we become self-controlled; by doing brave actions, we become brave.
11. Lawmakers make people good by habituation, which is the goal of every lawmaker.
12. Every virtue is produced or destroyed by the same actions that create it.
13. For example, playing the harp well makes a good harp player, and playing it badly makes a bad one.
14. The same goes for builders and other skills.
15. By acting in certain ways, we become just or unjust, brave or cowardly.
16. By behaving in certain ways regarding desires and anger, we become self-controlled or uncontrolled.
17. Habits are formed from actions, so we need to give the right character to our actions.
18. Whether we are trained in one way or another from childhood makes a big difference.

### Chapter II

1. The goal of this treatise is not just to know what virtue is, but to become virtuous.
2. We need to consider how to perform actions because the quality of our habits depends on them.
3. Acting according to right reason is a general rule, which we will discuss later.
4. All discussions on moral action must be general and not exact because moral actions are not fixed.
5. Specific cases require individual judgment, like in medicine or navigation.
6. Things can be spoiled by too much or too little, like health and strength.
7. Excessive or insufficient training can harm strength, just as too much or too little food can harm health.
8. The same goes for virtues like self-control and courage.
9. Someone who fears everything becomes a coward, and someone who fears nothing becomes rash.
10. Someone who indulges in every pleasure loses self-control, and someone who avoids all pleasures becomes dull.
11. Virtues are maintained by a balanced state, not by excess or deficiency.
12. The same actions that create virtues also maintain them.
13. For example, strength comes from eating well and exercising, and a strong person can best continue these actions.
14. By abstaining from pleasures, we become self-controlled, and once we are self-controlled, we can best abstain from pleasures.
15. By facing fears, we become brave, and once we are brave, we can best face fears.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions.

### Chapter II (continued)

1. To test if habits are formed, look at the pleasure or pain that follows actions.
2. A person with self-mastery not only avoids bodily pleasures but is happy to do so.
3. Someone who avoids pleasures but is unhappy about it does not have self-mastery.
4. A brave person faces danger with pleasure or at least without pain.
5. Someone who faces danger with pain is not truly brave.
6. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains because we do bad things for pleasure and avoid doing right things because of pain.
7. Plato said that people should be trained from childhood to feel pleasure and pain from the right things, which is proper education.
8. Virtues involve actions and feelings, and every action and feeling is followed by pleasure or pain.
9. This shows that virtue is connected to pleasure and pain.
10. Punishments use pleasure and pain because they are like remedies that counteract the bad behavior.
11. Every habit of the soul relates to things that can improve or worsen it, like pleasures and pains.
12. Bad habits come from pursuing or avoiding pleasures and pains in the wrong way, at the wrong time, or in the wrong manner.
13. Some people wrongly define virtues as states of being unaffected by anything, but they should add "as they ought" or "as they ought not" to their definitions.
14. Virtue is the habit that deals with pleasures and pains in the best way, while vice is the opposite.
15. Three things move us to choose or avoid: the honorable, the expedient, and the pleasant, and their opposites: the dishonorable, the harmful, and the painful.
16. Good people make the right choices regarding these, especially pleasure, which is common to all animals and hard to remove from our lives.
17. We measure actions by pleasure and pain, so our whole focus must be on them.
18. It's harder to fight against pleasure than anger, and virtue deals with difficult things.
19. Virtue and moral philosophy focus on pleasures and pains because using them well makes a person good, and using them poorly makes a person bad.
20. Virtue deals with pleasures and pains and is affected by the same circumstances that create it.

### Chapter III

1. Some might be confused by the idea that we must do just actions to become just and self-controlled actions to become self-controlled.
2. They might think that if we do these actions, we already have the virtues, like being a grammarian or musician by doing their actions.
3. But even in arts, a person might do something grammatical by chance or suggestion, not because they are a grammarian.
4. A grammarian does grammatical things because of their knowledge.
5. The arts and virtues are different because the excellence of arts is in the products, while virtues are in the actions and the state of the person doing them.
6. Virtuous actions must be done knowingly, with deliberate preference, and with stability.
7. For arts, only knowledge is needed, but for virtues, knowledge is not enough; the other conditions are essential.
8. These conditions come from repeatedly doing just and self-controlled actions.
9. Actions are called just or self-controlled when they are like those of a just or self-controlled person.
10. A person is not virtuous just by doing these actions but by doing them as a virtuous person would.
11. Virtues are formed by doing the actions, but not doing them means not becoming good.
12. Many people talk about virtues but don't practice them, like sick people who listen to a doctor but don't follow the advice.
13. Just as these people can't get healthy, those who only talk about virtues can't become good.

### Chapter IV

1. Next, we need to examine what virtue is.
2. Things in the mind are of three kinds: feelings, capacities, and states.
3. Virtue must belong to one of these three classes.
4. Feelings include things like lust, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, friendship, hatred, longing, emulation, and compassion.
5. Capacities are what make us capable of having these feelings.
6. States are how we relate to these feelings, whether in a good or bad way.
7. For example, being angry in the right way is a good state, while being too violent or too slack is a bad state.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, I'll break down this passage into simpler, modern language for you:

### Chapter IV (continued)

1. Feelings are not virtues or vices because we are not called good or bad based on our feelings, but we are based on our virtues and vices.
2. We are not praised or blamed for our feelings, but we are for our virtues and vices.
3. Feelings like anger and fear happen without moral choice, while virtues involve moral choice.
4. Feelings move us, but virtues and vices are about being disposed in a certain way.
5. Capacities are not virtues either because we are not called good or bad just for having the ability to feel.
6. Capacities are natural, but we do not become good or bad by nature.
7. Therefore, virtues must be states, not feelings or capacities.

### Chapter V

1. We have said that virtue is a state, but we need to explain what kind of state it is.
2. All excellence makes the thing it is the excellence of both good and able to perform its work well.
3. For example, the excellence of the eye makes it good and able to see well.
4. The excellence of a horse makes it good in speed, carrying its rider, and standing up against the enemy.
5. Similarly, the excellence of a person, or virtue, makes a person good and able to perform their proper work well.
6. Virtue is a state that makes a person good and able to perform their work well.
7. In all quantities, whether continuous or discrete, there is a greater part, a lesser part, and an equal part.
8. The equal part is the mean between excess and defect.
9. The absolute mean is equidistant from both extremes and is the same for everyone.
10. The relative mean is what is neither too much nor too little for a particular individual.
11. For example, if ten is too much and two is too little, six is the absolute mean.
12. But the relative mean depends on the individual; what is too much for one person might be too little for another.
13. Skilled people avoid excess and defect and choose the mean relative to themselves.
14. All skill aims at the mean to accomplish its work well.
15. Excellence, like nature, is more exact and better than any art and aims at the mean.
16. Moral excellence, or virtue, is concerned with feelings and actions, which can have excess, defect, and a mean.
17. Virtue involves feeling emotions like fear, confidence, lust, anger, compassion, and pleasure in the right amount, at the right time, towards the right people, for the right reasons.
18. Virtue is about finding the mean in feelings and actions, where excess is wrong, defect is blamed, and the mean is praised.
19. Virtue is a mean state because it aims at the mean.
20. It is easy to go wrong in many ways but hard to go right in one way.
21. Therefore, excess and defect belong to vice, and the mean state belongs to virtue.

### Chapter VI

1. Virtue is a state that involves deliberate choice, aiming at the relative mean, determined by reason, as a wise person would determine.
2. It is a middle state between two faulty ones: excess on one side and defect on the other.
3. Faulty states either fall short of or exceed what is right, while virtue finds and adopts the mean.
4. Virtue is a mean state in its essence and definition but is the highest state in terms of the chief good and excellence.
5. Not every action or feeling can have a mean state because some are inherently bad, like malevolence, shamelessness, envy, adultery, theft, and homicide.
6. These actions are always wrong, regardless of the amount or manner.
7. You cannot have a mean state, excess, or defect in inherently bad actions.
8. Just as there is no excess or defect in perfected self-mastery and courage, there is no mean state in inherently bad actions.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions.

### Chapter VI (continued)

1. It's not enough to talk about virtues in general; we need to look at specific examples.
2. General statements can seem vague, but detailed examples make them clearer.
3. Actions must be specific, and general statements must apply to these specifics to be useful.
4. Let's look at specific examples from a well-known scheme.

#### I. Fear and Confidence

21. Excessive pursuit of honor is called **Ambition**.
22. Lack of pursuit of honor is called **Unambitious**.
23. The mean state has no specific name, but we sometimes call it **Ambition** or **Unambitious** depending on the context.

#### VII. Anger
24. The mean state is **Meekness**.
25. Excessive anger is called **Passionateness**.

38. Excessive shame is called **Dumbfoundered**.
39. Lack of shame is called **Shameless**.
40. The right amount of shame is called **Shamefaced**.

### Indignation
41. **Indignation** is the mean state between **Envy** and **Malevolence**.
42. Indignation is feeling annoyed at undeserved success.
43. Envy is feeling annoyed at all success.
44. Malevolence is rejoicing at others' misfortune.

45. We will discuss these and other virtues, like Justice, in more detail later.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, I'll break down this passage into simpler, modern language for you:

### Chapter VII

1. There are three states in each case: two faulty (excess and defect) and one right (the mean).
2. These states are opposed to each other: the extremes are opposed to the mean and to each other.
3. For example, the brave person seems rash compared to the coward and cowardly compared to the rash person.
4. Similarly, a person with self-mastery seems uncontrolled compared to someone with no perception and overly controlled compared to someone with no self-control.
5. A liberal person seems prodigal compared to a stingy person and stingy compared to a prodigal person.
6. The extremes push the person in the mean state towards each other.
7. The brave person is called rash by the coward and cowardly by the rash person.
8. The opposition between extremes is greater than between either extreme and the mean.
9. Some extremes resemble the mean, like rashness to courage and prodigality to liberality.
10. The greatest dissimilarity is between the extremes.
11. The further apart things are, the more contrary they are.
12. Sometimes the excess is more opposed to the mean, and sometimes the defect is.
13. For courage, cowardice (the defect) is more opposed than rashness (the excess).
14. For self-mastery, lack of self-control (the excess) is more opposed than insensibility (the defect).
15. This is because one extreme is closer to the mean and resembles it more.
16. We have a natural bias towards pleasures, making us more inclined to lack self-control than to self-discipline.
17. Therefore, lack of self-control is more contrary to self-mastery than insensibility.

### Chapter VIII

1. Moral virtue is a mean state between two faulty states: one of excess and one of defect.
2. It aims at the mean in both feelings and actions.
3. It is hard to be good because finding the mean is difficult, like finding the center of a circle.
4. Anyone can be angry, give money, or be generous, but doing these things to the right person, in the right amount, at the right time, for the right reason, and in the right way is difficult.
5. This is why goodness is rare, praiseworthy, and noble.
6. To aim at the mean, one should avoid the extreme that is more contrary to the mean.
7. Like Calypso advising Ulysses to steer clear of danger, we should avoid the more erroneous extreme.
8. Since hitting the mean exactly is difficult, we should choose the lesser evil.
9. We should consider our natural biases, which vary for each person, and can be identified by the pleasure and pain we feel.
10. We should push ourselves in the opposite direction of our bias to find the mean, like straightening bent wood.
11. We must be careful with pleasure because we are not impartial judges of it.
12. We should treat pleasure cautiously, like the old counselors treated Helen, to avoid errors.
13. These precautions help us attain the mean.
14. It is difficult to determine exactly how, with whom, for what reasons, and for how long one should feel anger.
15. We sometimes praise those who are too mild and call them meek, and sometimes praise the hot-tempered as manly and spirited.
16. Small deviations from the mean are not blamed, only significant ones.
17. It is hard to determine the exact point at which a deviation becomes blameworthy.
18. These matters are decided by moral sense and are detailed and specific.
19. The mean state is always praiseworthy, and we should sometimes lean towards excess or defect to find the mean.
