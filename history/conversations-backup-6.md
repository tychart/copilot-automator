Sent by Copilot: Sure, I can help with that! Here's a modern, easy-to-understand version of Aristotle's text from Book II, Chapters I and II:

### Chapter I
1. Human excellence is of two kinds: intellectual and moral.
2. Intellectual excellence comes from teaching and requires experience and time.
3. Moral excellence comes from habit, which is why the Greek word for it is related to the word for habit.
4. Moral virtues are not in us by nature because things that exist by nature can't be changed by habit.
5. For example, a stone naturally falls down and can't be trained to go up, no matter how many times you throw it.
6. Virtues are not in us by nature, but we have the potential to develop them through habit.
7. We first have the ability to do things by nature, and then we perform actions.
8. For example, we have senses like sight and hearing before we use them.
9. But virtues come from performing actions first, like learning to build by building or play the harp by playing.
10. By doing just actions, we become just; by doing self-controlled actions, we become self-controlled; by doing brave actions, we become brave.
11. Lawmakers make people good by habituating them to good actions, which is the goal of every law.
12. Virtues are created and destroyed by the same actions, just like arts.
13. Good and bad harp players are made by playing the harp well or badly.
14. Similarly, builders become good or bad by building well or badly.
15. If this weren't true, we wouldn't need teachers; everyone would be good or bad at their arts naturally.
16. By interacting with others, we become just or unjust, brave or cowardly.
17. By behaving in certain ways, we develop habits of self-control or lack of it.
18. Habits are formed by actions, so we need to focus on doing the right actions.
19. Whether we develop good or bad habits from childhood makes a big difference.

### Chapter II
1. The goal of this treatise is not just to know what virtue is, but to become virtuous.
2. We need to consider how to perform actions because the quality of our habits depends on them.
3. Acting according to right reason is a general rule, which we'll discuss later.
4. Moral actions can't be described exactly because they depend on the situation, like health.
5. Exactness isn't possible in moral actions because they don't follow fixed rules.
6. We must try our best to understand them.
7. Things are spoiled by too much or too little, like health and strength.
8. Excessive or insufficient training harms strength; the right amount maintains it.
9. The same goes for food and drink.
10. Virtues like self-control and courage are spoiled by excess and deficiency but preserved by the right amount.
11. Habits are formed and maintained by the same actions.
12. Strength comes from eating well and exercising, and the strong can do these best.
13. Similarly, we become self-controlled by abstaining from pleasures and brave by facing fears.
14. Once we have these virtues, we can best maintain them.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern, easy-to-understand version of the passage you provided:

### Chapter II (continued)
1. To test if habits are formed, we should look at the pleasure or pain that follows actions.
2. A person with self-mastery not only avoids bodily pleasures but is happy to do so.
3. Someone who avoids pleasures but is unhappy about it does not have self-mastery.
4. A brave person faces danger with pleasure or at least without pain.
5. Someone who faces danger with pain is not truly brave.
6. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains because we do bad things for pleasure and avoid good things because of pain.
7. Plato said that people should be trained from childhood to feel pleasure and pain from the right things, which is proper education.
8. Virtues involve actions and feelings, and every action and feeling is followed by pleasure or pain.
9. This shows that virtue is about managing pleasure and pain.
10. Punishments work through pleasure and pain because they are like remedies that counteract the bad behavior.
11. Habits of the soul relate to things that can improve or worsen them, like pleasures and pains.
12. Bad habits form when people pursue or avoid pleasures and pains in the wrong way, at the wrong time, or in the wrong manner.
13. Some people wrongly define virtues as states of being unaffected by anything, but they should add "in the right way" and "at the right time."
14. Virtue is the habit that manages pleasures and pains to achieve the best results, while vice does the opposite.
15. Three things move us to make choices: the honorable, the useful, and the pleasant, and their opposites: the dishonorable, the harmful, and the painful.
16. Good people make the right choices, and bad people make the wrong ones, especially regarding pleasure.
17. Pleasure is common to all animals and is linked to things that move us to choose, like the honorable and the useful.
18. Pleasure grows with us from infancy, making it hard to remove from our lives.
19. We often use pleasure and pain to measure our actions.
20. It's important to get the right impressions of pleasure and pain because they influence our actions.
21. Heraclitus said it's harder to fight against pleasure than anger.
22. Virtue and moral philosophy focus on pleasures and pains because using them well makes us good, and using them badly makes us bad.
23. Virtue deals with pleasures and pains and is formed and maintained by the same actions that created it.

### Chapter III
1. Some might be confused by the idea that we must do just actions to become just and self-controlled actions to become self-controlled.
2. They might think that if we do these actions, we already have the virtues, like being a grammarian or musician by doing their actions.
3. But this isn't true even for arts because someone might do something grammatical by chance or suggestion, not because they are a grammarian.
4. A grammarian does grammatical things because of their knowledge.
5. Arts and virtues are different because arts produce things with excellence in themselves, while virtues produce actions of a certain kind.
6. Virtuous actions are not just about the actions themselves but also about the state of the person doing them.
7. To be virtuous, one must know what they are doing, choose to do it for its own sake, and be stable in their character.
8. Knowledge alone doesn't make one virtuous; the other qualities are essential.
9. These qualities come from repeatedly doing just and self-controlled actions.
10. Actions are called virtuous when they are like those of a just or self-controlled person.
11. But a person is not virtuous just by doing these actions; they must do them in the right way.
12. Virtues are formed by doing virtuous actions, but not doing them means one won't become good.
13. Many people talk about philosophy but don't practice it, like sick people who listen to a doctor but don't follow their advice.
14. Just as these people can't get healthy, those who only talk about virtue can't become good.

### Chapter IV
1. Next, we need to examine what virtue is.
2. Things in the mind are of three kinds: feelings, capacities, and states.
3. Feelings include emotions like lust, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, friendship, hatred, longing, emulation, and compassion.
4. Capacities are our abilities to feel these emotions.
5. States are our good or bad relations to these feelings, like being too angry or not angry enough.
6. Virtue must belong to one of these three classes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: ### Chapter IV (continued)
1. Feelings are not virtues or vices because we are not called good or bad based on our feelings, but on our virtues and vices.
2. We are not praised or blamed for our feelings, but for how we handle them.
3. For example, being afraid or angry isn't praised or blamed, but how we express these feelings is.
4. Feelings like anger and fear happen without moral choice, while virtues involve moral choice.
5. Feelings move us, but virtues and vices are about being disposed in a certain way.
6. Capacities are not virtues or vices either because we are not called good or bad just for having the ability to feel.
7. Capacities are natural, but we don't become good or bad by nature.
8. Therefore, virtues are not feelings or capacities; they must be states.

### Chapter V
1. We've said that virtue is a state, but we need to explain what kind of state it is.
2. All excellence makes something good and helps it perform its function well.
3. For example, the excellence of the eye makes it good and helps it see well.
4. The excellence of a horse makes it good at running, carrying a rider, and standing up to enemies.
5. Similarly, human excellence, or virtue, is a state that makes a person good and helps them perform their function well.
6. Virtue is about finding the mean between excess and defect.
7. The mean is the right amount, neither too much nor too little, and it varies for each person.
8. For example, the right amount of food for an athlete is different from that for a beginner.
9. Skilled people avoid excess and defect and aim for the mean.
10. Virtue is about aiming for the mean in feelings and actions.
11. Feeling emotions like fear, confidence, lust, anger, compassion, and pleasure in the right amount is the mean.
12. Virtue is praised for finding the mean, while excess and defect are blamed.
13. Virtue is a mean state because it aims for the mean.
14. It's easy to go wrong in many ways, but hard to get it right.
15. Therefore, excess and defect belong to vice, and the mean state belongs to virtue.

### Chapter VI
1. Virtue is a state that involves deliberate choice, aiming for the mean as determined by reason and practical wisdom.
2. It is a middle state between two faulty extremes: excess and defect.
3. Virtue finds and adopts the mean in feelings and actions.
4. Virtue is a mean state in essence but the highest state in terms of goodness and excellence.
5. Not every action or feeling can have a mean state because some are inherently bad, like malice, shamelessness, envy, adultery, theft, and murder.
6. These actions are always wrong, regardless of the amount or manner.
7. You can't have a mean state of excess or defect, just as you can't have excess or defect of a mean state.

### Chapter VII
1. We need to understand that virtues are formed by doing virtuous actions.
2. Just talking about virtue isn't enough; we must practice it to become good.
3. People who only talk about virtue are like sick people who listen to a doctor but don't follow their advice.
4. Just as these people can't get healthy, those who only talk about virtue can't become good.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: ### Chapter VII
1. It's not enough to talk about virtues in general; we need to look at specific examples.
2. General statements can seem vague, but detailed examples make them clearer.
3. Actions must be specific, and general statements must apply to these specifics.
4. Let's look at specific virtues and their extremes.

#### I. Courage
5. Courage is the mean state between fear and confidence.
6. Too much confidence is rashness, and too much fear is cowardice.

#### II. Self-Mastery
7. Self-mastery is the mean state regarding pleasures and pains.
8. Lack of self-control is the defect.
9. There's no real term for people who have too little pleasure, but we can call them insensible.

#### III. Liberality
10. Liberality is the mean state in giving and taking wealth.
11. Prodigality is the excess, and stinginess is the defect.
12. Prodigal people give too much and take too little, while stingy people take too much and give too little.

#### IV. Munificence
13. Munificence deals with great wealth, unlike liberality, which deals with small amounts.
14. The excess is vulgar profusion, and the defect is paltriness.

#### V. Greatness of Soul
15. Greatness of soul is the mean state regarding honor.
16. The excess is called vanity, and the defect is littleness of soul.

#### VI. Ambition
17. Ambition relates to small honors.
18. Excessive ambition is called ambitious, and the lack of it is unambitious.
19. The mean state doesn't have a specific name, but we sometimes call it ambition.

#### VII. Meekness
20. Meekness is the mean state regarding anger.
21. Excessive anger is called passionateness, and the lack of anger is called angerlessness.

### Other Mean States
22. There are three other mean states related to social interactions.
23. These involve truth, relaxation, and daily life.

#### I. Truthfulness
24. Truthfulness is the mean state regarding truth.
25. Exaggeration is called braggadocia, and understatement is called reserve.

#### II. Easy-Pleasantry
26. Easy-pleasantry is the mean state in relaxation and amusement.
27. Excess is buffoonery, and deficiency is clownishness.

#### III. Friendliness
28. Friendliness is the mean state in daily life.
29. Excess without motive is complaisance, with motive is flattery.
30. Deficiency is quarrelsomeness and crossness.

### Shamefacedness
31. Shamefacedness is not a virtue but is praised.
32. Excessive shame is called dumbfoundered, and lack of shame is called shameless.
33. The right amount of shame is called shamefaced.

### Indignation
34. Indignation is the mean state between envy and malevolence.
35. Indignation is feeling annoyed at undeserved success.
36. Envy is feeling annoyed at all success, and malevolence is rejoicing at others' misfortune.

### Justice
37. We'll discuss justice and intellectual virtues in detail later.

I hope this breakdown helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: ### Chapter VIII
1. There are three states in each case: two faulty (excess and defect) and one right (the mean).
2. These states are opposed to each other: the extremes oppose the mean and each other.
3. For example, the brave person seems rash to the coward and cowardly to the rash person.
4. Similarly, the self-controlled person seems indulgent to the insensible and insensible to the indulgent.
5. The liberal person seems prodigal to the stingy and stingy to the prodigal.
6. Extremes push the mean state towards each other, making the mean appear different depending on the perspective.
7. The contrariety between extremes is greater than between either extreme and the mean.
8. Some extremes resemble the mean more than others, like rashness to courage and prodigality to liberality.
9. The further apart things are, the more contrary they are.
10. Sometimes the excess is more opposed to the mean, and sometimes the defect is.
11. For courage, cowardice (defect) is more opposed than rashness (excess).
12. For self-mastery, lack of self-control (excess) is more opposed than insensibility (defect).
13. This is because one extreme is closer to the mean and resembles it more.
14. We have a natural bias towards certain extremes, like pleasure, making us more inclined to lack self-control.
15. Therefore, lack of self-control is more contrary to self-mastery than insensibility.

### Chapter IX
1. Moral virtue is a mean state between two faulty states: excess and defect.
2. It aims at the mean in both feelings and actions.
3. It's hard to be good because finding the mean is difficult, like finding the center of a circle.
4. Anyone can get angry, give money, or be generous, but doing these things in the right way is hard.
5. Goodness is rare, praiseworthy, and noble because it's difficult to achieve.
6. To aim at the mean, avoid the extreme that is more contrary to it.
7. Like Ulysses avoiding danger in Homer's story, avoid the greater error.
8. Since hitting the exact mean is hard, choose the lesser of two evils.
9. Consider your natural biases, which vary for each person.
10. Push yourself in the opposite direction of your bias to find the mean, like straightening bent wood.
11. Be cautious of pleasure because we are not impartial judges of it.
12. Treat pleasure like the old counselors treated Helen, by sending it away to avoid error.
13. These precautions help us attain the mean.
14. It's difficult to determine exactly how to act in specific situations.
15. We sometimes praise people for being too meek or too spirited.
16. Small deviations from the mean are not blamed, but large ones are.
17. It's hard to define in words how much deviation is blameworthy.
18. These decisions are matters of moral sense and perception.
19. The mean state is always praiseworthy, and we should aim for it by sometimes leaning towards excess or defect.

I hope this helps clarify Aristotle's ideas! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
