Sent by Copilot: Sure, I can help with that! Here's a modern and simpler version of Aristotle's text from Book II, Chapters I and II:

### Chapter I

1. Human excellence is of two types: intellectual and moral.
2. Intellectual excellence comes from teaching and requires experience and time.
3. Moral excellence comes from habit, which is why the Greek word for it is related to the word for habit.
4. Moral virtues are not in us by nature because things that are natural cannot be changed by habit.
5. For example, a stone naturally falls downward and cannot be trained to go upward.
6. Virtues are not in us by nature, but we have the capacity to develop them through habit.
7. We first have the ability to do things by nature, and then we perform actions.
8. For example, we have senses like sight and hearing naturally, and we use them because we have them.
9. But virtues are developed by first performing actions, like learning to build by building or playing the harp by playing it.
10. By doing just actions, we become just; by doing self-controlled actions, we become self-controlled; by doing brave actions, we become brave.
11. Lawmakers make people good by habituating them to good actions, and this is the goal of every lawmaker.
12. Virtue is produced and destroyed by the same actions, just like art.
13. For example, good and bad harp players are made by playing the harp well or poorly.
14. Similarly, builders become good or bad by building well or poorly.
15. If this were not true, there would be no need for teachers, and everyone would be good or bad naturally.
16. Virtues are developed by acting in various situations with other people.
17. By acting in dangerous situations, we become brave or cowardly.
18. By dealing with desires and anger, we become self-controlled or uncontrolled.
19. Habits are formed from actions, so we need to give the right character to our actions.
20. Whether we are trained in one way or another from childhood makes a big difference.

### Chapter II

1. The goal of this treatise is not just to know what virtue is, but to become virtuous.
2. We need to consider how to perform actions because the quality of our habits depends on them.
3. Acting according to right reason is a general rule, which we will discuss later.
4. All discussions on moral action must be general and not exact because moral actions are not fixed.
5. Specific cases do not follow exact rules and must be judged individually, like in medicine or navigation.
6. We must try to do our best even though the subject is complex.
7. Virtues are spoiled by excess and deficiency, just like health and strength.
8. Too much or too little exercise or food can harm health, while the right amount preserves it.
9. Similarly, virtues like self-control and courage are spoiled by excess and deficiency.
10. A person who fears everything becomes a coward, while one who fears nothing becomes rash.
11. Someone who indulges in every pleasure loses self-control, while one who avoids all pleasures becomes insensitive.
12. Virtues are preserved by the right balance, not by excess or deficiency.
13. The same actions that create virtues also maintain them.
14. For example, strength comes from eating well and exercising, and a strong person can do these best.
15. By abstaining from pleasures, we develop self-control, and once we have it, we can best abstain from pleasures.
16. By facing fears, we become brave, and once we are brave, we can best face fears.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern and simpler version of the passage you provided:

### Chapter II (continued)

1. To test if habits are formed, we should look at the pleasure or pain that follows actions.
2. A person who has self-mastery not only avoids bodily pleasures but is happy to do so.
3. Someone who avoids pleasures but is unhappy about it does not have self-mastery.
4. A brave person faces danger with pleasure or at least without pain.
5. Someone who faces danger with pain is not truly brave.
6. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains because we do bad things for pleasure and avoid doing right things because of pain.
7. Plato said that people should be trained from childhood to feel pleasure and pain from the right things, which is proper education.
8. Virtues involve actions and feelings, and every action and feeling is followed by pleasure or pain.
9. This shows that virtue is connected to pleasure and pain.
10. Punishments work through pleasure and pain because they are like remedies that counteract the bad.
11. Every habit of the soul is related to things that can improve or worsen it, like pleasures and pains.
12. Habits become bad when people pursue or avoid pleasures and pains in the wrong way, at the wrong time, or in the wrong manner.
13. Some people wrongly define virtues as states of being unaffected by anything, but they should add "as they ought" or "as they ought not" to their definitions.
14. Virtue is the habit that deals with pleasures and pains in the best way, while vice is the opposite.
15. Three things move us to choose or avoid actions: the honorable, the useful, and the pleasant, and their opposites: the dishonorable, the harmful, and the painful.
16. Good people make the right choices regarding these things, especially pleasure, which is common to all animals and hard to remove from our lives.
17. We often use pleasure and pain as measures for our actions.
18. It's important to get the right impressions of pleasure and pain because they influence our actions.
19. Heraclitus said it's harder to fight against pleasure than anger.
20. Virtue and moral philosophy focus on pleasures and pains because using them well makes us good, and using them poorly makes us bad.
21. Virtue deals with pleasures and pains and is formed and maintained by the same actions that created it.

### Chapter III

1. Some might be confused by the idea that we must do just actions to become just and self-controlled actions to become self-controlled.
2. They might think that if we do these actions, we already have the virtues, like being a grammarian or musician by doing their actions.
3. But even in arts, a person might do something grammatical by chance or suggestion, not because they are a grammarian.
4. A grammarian does grammatical things because of their own knowledge.
5. The arts and virtues are different because the excellence of arts is in the products themselves, while virtues are in the actions and the state of the person doing them.
6. Virtuous actions must be done knowingly, with deliberate choice, and for their own sake, and the person must be stable in their character.
7. Knowledge alone is not enough for virtues; the other conditions are essential.
8. These conditions come from repeatedly doing just and self-controlled actions.
9. Actions are called just or self-controlled when they are like those done by just or self-controlled people.
10. A person is not virtuous just by doing these actions but by doing them as a virtuous person would.
11. Virtues are formed by doing the actions, but not doing them means not becoming good.
12. Many people talk about virtues but do not practice them, like patients who listen to doctors but do not follow their advice.
13. Just as these patients cannot get healthy, people cannot become virtuous by just talking about it.

### Chapter IV

1. Next, we need to examine what virtue is.
2. Things in the mind are of three kinds: feelings, capacities, and states.
3. Virtue must belong to one of these three classes.
4. Feelings include lust, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, friendship, hatred, longing, emulation, and compassion, all followed by pleasure or pain.
5. Capacities are what make us capable of these feelings, like being able to get angry or feel compassion.
6. States are how we relate to these feelings, being good or bad in our reactions.
7. For example, being too angry or not angry enough is bad, but being in the right balance is good.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: ### Chapter IV (continued)

1. Feelings are not virtues or vices because we are not called good or bad based on our feelings, but we are based on our virtues and vices.
2. We are not praised or blamed for our feelings, but we are for our virtues and vices.
3. Feelings like anger and fear happen without moral choice, while virtues involve moral choice.
4. Feelings move us, but virtues and vices are about being disposed in a certain way.
5. Capacities are not virtues or vices either because we are not called good or bad just for having the ability to feel.
6. Capacities are natural, but we do not become good or bad by nature.
7. Therefore, virtues are not feelings or capacities; they must be states.

### Chapter V

1. We have said that virtue is a state, but we need to explain what kind of state it is.
2. All excellence makes the thing it is the excellence of both good and able to perform its work well.
3. For example, the excellence of the eye makes the eye good and able to see well.
4. The excellence of a horse makes it good, fast, able to carry its rider, and stand up against the enemy.
5. Similarly, the excellence of a person, or virtue, makes a person good and able to perform their proper work well.
6. Virtue is a state that makes a person good and able to perform their proper work well.
7. In all quantities, whether continuous or discrete, there is a greater part, a lesser part, and an equal part, which is the mean.
8. The mean is equidistant from both extremes and is the same for everyone.
9. The mean relative to us is what is neither too much nor too little for the individual.
10. For example, if ten is too much and two is too little, six is the absolute mean.
11. But the mean relative to us is not always the same; it depends on the individual.
12. For example, ten minae might be too much to eat and two too little, but six might still be too much or too little for different people.
13. Skilled people avoid excess and defect and choose the mean relative to themselves.
14. All skill aims at the mean, and good artisans work with this in mind.
15. Excellence, like nature, is more exact and better than any art and aims at the mean.
16. Moral excellence, or virtue, is concerned with feelings and actions, which can have excess, defect, and the mean.
17. It is possible to feel emotions like fear, confidence, lust, anger, compassion, and pleasure too much or too little, and in either case, it is wrong.
18. To feel them at the right time, on the right occasions, towards the right people, for the right reasons, and in the right way is the mean and the best state, which is the property of virtue.
19. Similarly, actions can have excess, defect, and the mean.
20. Virtue is concerned with feelings and actions, where excess is wrong, defect is blamed, and the mean is praised and correct.
21. Virtue is a mean state because it aims at the mean.
22. It is easy to go wrong in many ways but hard to go right in one way.
23. Therefore, excess and defect belong to vice, and the mean state belongs to virtue.

### Chapter VI

1. Virtue is a state that involves deliberate choice, aiming at the mean relative to us, determined by reason, as a wise person would determine.
2. It is a middle state between two faulty ones, one of excess and one of defect.
3. Faulty states fall short of or exceed what is right, both in feelings and actions, but virtue finds and adopts the mean.
4. Virtue is a mean state in its essence and definition, but in reference to the chief good and excellence, it is the highest state possible.
5. Not every action or feeling can have a mean state because some are inherently bad, like malevolence, shamelessness, envy, adultery, theft, and homicide.
6. These actions are always wrong, regardless of the person, time, or manner.
7. There is no mean state, excess, or defect for inherently bad actions; they are always wrong.
8. Just as there is no excess or defect for self-mastery and courage, there is no mean state, excess, or defect for inherently bad actions.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: ### Chapter VII

1. It's not enough to talk about virtues in general; we need to look at specific examples to make things clearer.
2. General statements can seem vague, but detailed examples make them more real.
3. Actions must be specific, and general statements must apply to these specifics to be useful.
4. Let's look at specific examples from a well-known scheme.

#### I. Fear and Confidence
- **Mean State**: Courage
- **Excess**: Rashness (too much confidence)
- **Deficiency**: Cowardice (too much fear)

#### II. Pleasures and Pains
- **Mean State**: Self-Mastery
- **Deficiency**: Lack of Self-Control
- **Excess**: There is no common term for people who have too little pleasure, but we can call them "insensible."

#### III. Giving and Taking Wealth (a)
- **Mean State**: Liberality
- **Excess**: Prodigality (giving too much, taking too little)
- **Deficiency**: Stinginess (taking too much, giving too little)

#### IV. Wealth (b)
- **Mean State**: Munificence (dealing with great wealth)
- **Excess**: Vulgar Profusion or Lack of Taste
- **Deficiency**: Paltriness

#### V. Honor and Dishonor (a)
- **Mean State**: Greatness of Soul
- **Excess**: Vanity
- **Deficiency**: Smallness of Soul

#### VI. Honor and Dishonor (b)
- **Mean State**: There is no specific name, but it deals with small honors.
- **Excess**: Ambition
- **Deficiency**: Lack of Ambition

#### VII. Anger
- **Mean State**: Meekness
- **Excess**: Passionateness
- **Deficiency**: Lack of Anger

#### Other Mean States
- **Truthfulness**: Mean state in respect to truth.
  - **Excess**: Braggadocia (exaggeration)
  - **Deficiency**: Reserve (understatement)
- **Easy-Pleasantry**: Mean state in respect to amusement.
  - **Excess**: Buffoonery
  - **Deficiency**: Clownishness
- **Friendliness**: Mean state in daily life.
  - **Excess**: Too Complaisant or Flatterer (if with motive)
  - **Deficiency**: Quarrelsome and Cross

#### Feelings and Matters Concerning Them
- **Shamefacedness**: Not a virtue, but praised.
  - **Excess**: Overwhelmed with shame (Dumbfounded)
  - **Deficiency**: Shamelessness
- **Indignation**: Mean state between Envy and Malevolence.
  - **Excess**: Envy (annoyed at all success of others)
  - **Deficiency**: Malevolence (rejoices at others' misfortune)

### Chapter VIII

1. We will discuss these virtues in detail later, including Justice and Intellectual Excellences.

I hope this breakdown helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: ### Chapter VIII

1. There are three states in each case: two faulty (excess and defect) and one right (the mean).
2. These states are opposed to each other: the extremes oppose the mean and each other.
3. For example, the brave person seems rash to the coward and cowardly to the rash person.
4. Similarly, the self-controlled person seems indulgent to the insensible and insensible to the indulgent.
5. The liberal person seems prodigal to the stingy and stingy to the prodigal.
6. The extremes push the mean state towards each other, making the mean appear different depending on the comparison.
7. The opposition between extremes is greater than between either extreme and the mean.
8. Some extremes resemble the mean more than others, like rashness to courage and prodigality to liberality.
9. The further apart things are, the more contrary they are.
10. Sometimes the excess is more opposed to the mean, and sometimes the defect is.
11. For courage, cowardice (defect) is more opposed than rashness (excess).
12. For self-mastery, lack of self-control (excess) is more opposed than insensibility (defect).
13. This is because one extreme is closer to the mean and resembles it more.
14. We have a natural bias towards pleasure, making us more inclined to lack self-control than to self-discipline.
15. Therefore, lack of self-control is more contrary to self-mastery than insensibility is.

### Chapter IX

1. Moral virtue is a mean state between two faulty states (excess and defect).
2. It aims at the mean in both feelings and actions.
3. It is hard to be good because finding the mean is difficult, like finding the center of a circle.
4. Anyone can be angry, give money, or be generous, but doing these things in the right way is hard.
5. Goodness is rare, praiseworthy, and noble because it is difficult to achieve.
6. To aim at the mean, avoid the extreme that is more contrary to the mean.
7. Like Calypso advising Ulysses to steer clear of danger, avoid the greater error.
8. Since hitting the exact mean is difficult, choose the lesser of two evils.
9. Consider your natural biases, which vary for each person, and adjust accordingly.
10. Push yourself in the opposite direction of your bias to find the mean, like straightening bent wood.
11. Be cautious of pleasure because we are not impartial judges of it.
12. Treat pleasure like the old counselors treated Helen, by keeping it at a distance to avoid error.
13. These precautions help us aim for the mean.
14. It is difficult to determine the exact right way to feel or act in specific situations.
15. We sometimes praise people for being too mild or too spirited, depending on the context.
16. Small deviations from the mean are not blamed, but significant ones are.
17. The exact point of blame is hard to determine and depends on moral sense.
18. The mean state is praiseworthy, and we should sometimes lean towards excess or defect to find it.

I hope this helps clarify Aristotle's ideas! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
