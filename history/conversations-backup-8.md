Sent by Copilot: Sure, I can help with that! Here's a modern, easy-to-understand version of Aristotle's text:

**Chapter I:**

1. Human excellence is of two kinds: intellectual and moral.
2. Intellectual excellence comes from teaching and needs experience and time.
3. Moral excellence comes from habit, which is why the Greek word for it is related to the word for habit.
4. Moral virtues are not in us by nature because things that exist by nature can't be changed by habit.
5. For example, a stone naturally falls down and can't be trained to go up, no matter how many times you throw it.
6. Virtues are not in us by nature, but we have the capacity to develop them through habit.
7. We first get the ability to do things by nature, and then we perform the actions.
8. For example, we didn't get our senses by using them; we had them first and then used them.
9. But virtues are developed by first performing actions, like learning to build by building.
10. By doing just actions, we become just; by doing self-controlled actions, we become self-controlled; by doing brave actions, we become brave.
11. Lawmakers make people good by habituation, which is the goal of every lawmaker.
12. Virtues are produced or destroyed by the same actions, just like art.
13. For example, good and bad harp players are made by playing the harp.
14. Similarly, builders become good or bad by building well or poorly.
15. If this weren't true, we wouldn't need teachers, and everyone would be good or bad at their arts naturally.
16. Virtues are developed by interacting with others and facing different situations.
17. By acting in dangerous situations, we become brave or cowardly.
18. By dealing with desires and anger, we become self-controlled or passionate.
19. Habits are formed from actions, so we need to focus on doing the right actions.
20. How we are raised from childhood makes a big difference in our habits.

**Chapter II:**

1. The goal of this treatise is not just to know what virtue is, but to become virtuous.
2. We need to consider how to perform actions because the quality of our habits depends on them.
3. Acting according to right reason is a general rule, which we'll discuss later.
4. Moral actions can't be described exactly because they depend on the situation, like health.
5. Exactness isn't possible in moral actions because they don't follow fixed rules.
6. Each person must judge the situation, like in medicine or navigation.
7. We must try our best to understand and practice moral actions.
8. Virtues are spoiled by excess and deficiency, like health and strength.
9. Too much or too little training, food, or drink can harm health.
10. Similarly, too much or too little fear or pleasure can spoil virtues.
11. Virtues are preserved by the right balance, not by excess or deficiency.
12. The same actions that create virtues also maintain them.
13. For example, strength comes from eating well and exercising, and strong people can do these things best.
14. By abstaining from pleasures, we become self-controlled, and once we are self-controlled, we can best abstain from pleasures.
15. By facing fears, we become brave, and once we are brave, we can best face fears.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern, easy-to-understand version of the passage:

**Chapter II (continued):**

1. To test if habits are formed, we should look at the pleasure or pain that follows actions.
2. A person with self-control not only avoids bodily pleasures but is happy to do so.
3. Someone who avoids pleasures but is unhappy about it doesn't have self-control.
4. A brave person faces danger with pleasure or at least without pain.
5. Someone who faces danger with pain is not truly brave.
6. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains because we do bad things for pleasure and avoid good things because of pain.
7. Plato said that people should be trained from childhood to feel pleasure and pain from the right things, which is proper education.
8. Virtues involve actions and feelings, and every action and feeling is followed by pleasure or pain.
9. This shows that virtue is related to pleasure and pain.
10. Punishments use pleasure and pain because they act as remedies, which are the opposites of the problems they fix.
11. Every habit of the soul relates to things that can improve or worsen it, like pleasures and pains.
12. Bad habits form when people pursue or avoid things they shouldn't, or at the wrong times or in the wrong ways.
13. Some people wrongly define virtues as states of being unaffected by anything, but they should add "as they ought" or "when they ought."
14. Virtue is the habit that produces the best results in relation to pleasures and pains, while vice is the opposite.
15. Three things move us to choose or avoid: the honorable, the useful, and the pleasant, and their opposites: the dishon

**Chapter II (continued):**

1. It's not enough to talk about virtues in general; we need to look at specific examples.
2. General statements can seem vague, but detailed ones feel more real.
3. Actions must be specific, and general statements must apply to these specifics to be useful.
4. Let's look at specific examples from a well-known scheme.

**I. Fears and Confidence:**
- The mean state is Courage.
- Too little fear or too much confidence is called rashness.
- Too much fear and too little confidence is called cowardice.

**II. Pleasures and Pains:**
- The mean state is Self-Mastery.
- The defect is a total lack of Self-Control.
- There's no real name for people who have too little pleasure, but we can call them insensible.

**III. Giving and Taking Wealth (a):**
- The mean state is Liberality.
- The excess is Prodigality (giving too much and taking too little).
- The defect is Stinginess (taking too much and giving too little).

**IV. Wealth (b):**
- The mean state is Munificence (dealing with great wealth).
- The excess is Vulgar
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern, easy-to-understand version of the passage:

**Chapter IX:**

1. There are three states in each case: two faulty (excess and defect) and one right (the mean state).
2. These states are opposed to each other: the extremes oppose the mean and each other, and the mean opposes the extremes.
3. For example, the brave person seems rash compared to the coward and cowardly compared to the rash person.
4. Similarly, the self-controlled person seems indulgent compared to the insensible person and insensible compared to the indulgent person.
5. The liberal person seems
