**Part 1: The Pursuit of Knowledge**

Humans have a natural curiosity and desire to understand the world around them. This is evident in our love for learning and exploring new things, especially through our sense of sight. Seeing allows us to observe and understand the differences between objects.

Animals are born with the ability to sense their surroundings, and some develop memory, making them more intelligent and capable of learning. While animals rely on appearances and memories, humans use reason and logic to understand the world. Experience, which is gained through repeated memories, forms the basis for knowledge and understanding.

Art and science are both derived from experience, but art involves generalizing from specific observations, while science focuses on understanding the underlying causes. Although experience can be valuable, knowledge and understanding are often associated with art and the ability to explain why things happen.

Wisdom is considered to be the knowledge of fundamental principles and causes. Those who can teach and explain these principles are generally regarded as wiser than those who simply have practical experience. While the senses provide knowledge of particulars, they do not explain the underlying reasons for things.

The invention of new arts and sciences has been admired throughout history. Initially, inventors of practical tools were respected, but as society progressed, those who explored theoretical knowledge and abstract concepts were often considered wiser. This shift occurred as people had more leisure time to pursue intellectual pursuits.
