Here's a sentence-by-sentence breakdown of the provided text, aiming for modern language and simplicity:

**Part 1:**

* **Sentence 1:** Everyone is naturally curious and wants to learn things.
* **Sentence 2:** This desire to know is evident in how much we enjoy using our senses, especially sight.
* **Sentence 3:** We prefer seeing things because it helps us understand differences between objects better than other senses do.

* **Sentence 4:** Animals are born with the ability to sense their surroundings, and some can remember those experiences.
* **Sentence 5:** Animals that can remember are smarter and better at learning than those who can't.
* **Sentence 6:**  Even animals like bees, which can't hear, are intelligent but can't be taught in the same way as hearing animals.

* **Sentence 7:** Hearing animals, along with their memories, can be trained and learn new things.
* **Sentence 8:** Most animals live based on instinct and what they remember from past experiences.
* **Sentence 9:** Humans are unique because we use not only instincts and memories but also reason and art to understand the world.

* **Sentence 10:** Experiences build upon memories, and repeated similar experiences lead to a deeper understanding of something specific.
* **Sentence 11:** Experience is close to science and art, but true science and art come from experience because it's through experience that we learn patterns and rules.

* **Sentence 12:** A saying goes, "Experience makes art, while inexperience relies on luck."

* **Sentence 13:** Art emerges when we combine many individual experiences into a general rule or understanding about a group of things.
* **Sentence 14:** For example, noticing that a specific remedy helps people with fevers is an experience, but knowing it works for all people with certain body types who have fevers is art because it's a broader understanding.

* **Sentence 15:** Experience can be just as effective as knowledge in guiding actions, and sometimes even better.

* **Sentence 16:** This is because experience deals with specific cases, while theoretical knowledge focuses on general rules.
* **Sentence 17:** A doctor applies theory but ultimately treats individual patients like Callias or Socrates, not "mankind" in general.
* **Sentence 18:** Someone with only theory might know the general rule but fail to apply it correctly to a specific case because they lack the individual experience.

* **Sentence 19:** We generally believe that art (knowledge) is superior to experience because artists understand the "why" behind things, while experienced individuals may only know "that" something happens.

* **Sentence 20:** Artists understand the causes and reasons behind phenomena, whereas those with experience simply observe the results.
* **Sentence 21:**  We see skilled craftsmen as wiser than manual laborers because they understand the principles behind their craft, while laborers often work through habit and repetition.
* **Sentence 22:** We believe that true knowledge involves understanding the "why," which is why we consider art (theoretical knowledge) to be more valuable than experience.

* **Sentence 23:**  We don't view senses as wisdom, even though they provide detailed information about specific things.
* **Sentence 24:** Senses can tell us that fire is hot but not explain *why* it is hot.

* **Sentence 25:** The first inventors of practical arts were initially admired for their ingenuity and usefulness.
* **Sentence 26:** As more arts emerged, those focused on knowledge and understanding (like mathematics) gained higher status because they weren't directly tied to practical needs.

* **Sentence 27:**  This shift towards knowledge-based pursuits happened in societies where people had leisure time to contemplate abstract ideas, such as ancient Egypt.
* **Sentence 28:** This text aims to explore what wisdom truly is and how it relates to different types of knowledge.
