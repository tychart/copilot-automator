Here's a sentence-by-sentence breakdown of the opening section of Plato's *Republic*, using modern language and simpler vocabulary:

**Part 1**

* **"ALL men by nature desire to know."** People are naturally curious and want to understand the world around them.
* **"An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves; and above all others the sense of sight."**  We
enjoy using our senses, especially seeing things, even when it doesn't serve a practical purpose. Seeing helps us learn about differences between things.
* **"For not only with a view to action, but even when we are not going to do anything, we prefer seeing (one might say) to everything else."**  We often choose to see things simply
because it's pleasurable, not just because we need to do something.
* **"The reason is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know and brings to light many differences between things."** Sight helps us understand the world by revealing how
different things are from each other.
* **"By nature animals are born with the faculty of sensation, and from sensation memory is produced in some of them, though not in others."** Animals can sense their surroundings,
and some animals can remember experiences.
* **"And therefore the former are more intelligent and apt at learning than those which cannot remember; those which are incapable of hearing sounds are intelligent though they
cannot be taught, e.g. the bee, and any other race of animals that may be like it; and those which besides memory have this sense of hearing can be taught."** Animals with good
memories are smarter and learn more easily than those without.  Animals that can't hear (like bees) are still intelligent but can't be trained. Animals with both memory and hearing
can be taught things.
* **"The animals other than man live by appearances and memories, and have but little of connected experience; but the human race lives also by art and reasonings."**  Animals rely
mostly on their senses and memories to survive, while humans use skills (art) and logic (reasoning) too.
* **"Now from memory experience is produced in men; for the several memories of the same thing produce finally the capacity for a single experience."** Repeated experiences lead to a
broader understanding of things.
* **"And experience seems pretty much like science and art, but really science and art come to men through experience; for 'experience made art', as Polus says, 'but inexperience
luck'."** Experience is similar to knowledge (science) and skills (art), but it's through experience that we gain both.
* **"Now art arises when from many notions gained by experience one universal judgement about a class of objects is produced."**

  We develop skills when we take many experiences and learn general rules about how things work.

* **"For to have a judgement that when Callias was ill of this disease this did him good, and similarly in the case of Socrates and in many individual cases, is a matter of
experience; but to judge that it has done good to all persons of a certain constitution, marked off in one class, when they were ill of this disease, e.g. to phlegmatic or bilious
people, is science."**

  Knowing something works for specific individuals is experience. Knowing how it works for a whole group of people with shared characteristics is scientific knowledge.
* **"At first he who invented any art whatever that went beyond the common perceptions of man was naturally admired by men, not only because there was something useful in the
inventions, but because he was thought wise and superior to the rest."** People respected those who invented things that were both practical and clever.

* **"But as more arts were invented, and some were directed to the necessities of life, others to recreation, the inventors of the latter were naturally always regarded as wiser than
the inventors of the former, because their branches of knowledge did not aim at utility."**  As time went on, people came to value knowledge that wasn't directly useful for survival.


* **"Hence when all such inventions were already established, the sciences which do not aim at giving pleasure or at the necessities of life were discovered, and first in the places
where men first began to have leisure."**

   The study of things purely for knowledge sake developed later, often in societies that had time and resources for intellectual pursuits.
* **"This is why the mathematical arts were founded in Egypt; for there the priestly caste was allowed to be at leisure."**  One example of this is the development of math in ancient
Egypt, where priests had more free time for study.

* **"We have said in the Ethics what the difference is between art and science and the other kindred faculties; but the point of our present discussion is this, that all men suppose
what is called Wisdom to deal with the first causes and the principles of things; so that, as has been said before, the man of experience is thought to be wiser than the possessors
of any sense-perception whatever, the artist wiser than the men of experience, the masterworker than the mechanic, and the theoretical kinds of knowledge to be more of the nature of
Wisdom than the productive. Clearly then Wisdom is knowledge about certain principles and causes."**

The main point here is that people generally believe true wisdom involves understanding the fundamental reasons for things, not just practical skills or sensory experience.
