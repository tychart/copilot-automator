Sent by Copilot: Sure, I can help with that! Hereâ€™s a modern and simplified version of Aristotle's text from Book II, Chapters I and II:

### Chapter I

1. Human excellence is of two types: intellectual and moral.
2. Intellectual excellence comes from teaching and needs experience and time.
3. Moral excellence comes from habit, which is why the Greek word for it is related to the word for habit.
4. Moral virtues are not in us by nature because things that are natural cannot be changed by habit.
5. For example, a stone naturally falls down and cannot be trained to go up.
6. Virtues are not natural, but we have the potential to develop them through habit.
7. We first have the ability to do things by nature, and then we perform actions.
8. For example, we have senses like sight and hearing before we use them.
9. Virtues are developed by doing actions, just like arts are learned by practicing them.
10. For example, we become builders by building and harp players by playing the harp.
11. By doing just actions, we become just; by doing self-controlled actions, we become self-controlled; by doing brave actions, we become brave.
12. Lawmakers make people good by habituating them to good actions.
13. This is the goal of every lawmaker, and those who fail at this fail in their purpose.
14. Virtues are created and destroyed by the same actions.
15. For example, playing the harp well makes a good harp player, and playing badly makes a bad one.
16. The same applies to builders and other professions.
17. If this were not true, there would be no need for teachers.
18. By interacting with others, we become just or unjust, brave or cowardly.
19. By behaving in certain ways, we develop habits of self-control or lack of it.
20. Habits are formed by actions, so we must be careful about our actions.
21. How we are trained from childhood makes a big difference in our character.

### Chapter II

1. The purpose of this treatise is not just to understand virtue but to become virtuous.
2. We need to consider how to perform actions because habits depend on them.
3. Acting according to right reason is a general rule.
4. We will discuss what right reason is and its relation to other virtues later.
5. Moral actions cannot be described exactly but only in general terms.
6. Moral actions and what is expedient have no fixed rules, like matters of health.
7. Specific cases require individual judgment, like in medicine or navigation.
8. We must try to do our best even if exactness is not possible.
9. Virtues are spoiled by excess and deficiency, like health and strength.
10. Too much or too little training, food, or drink can harm health.
11. The same applies to virtues like self-control and courage.
12. Fearing everything makes one a coward; fearing nothing makes one rash.
13. Indulging in every pleasure leads to lack of self-control; avoiding all pleasures leads to insensitivity.
14. Virtues are preserved by the right balance, not by excess or deficiency.
15. The same actions that create virtues also maintain them.
16. For example, strength comes from eating well and exercising, and strong people can do these things best.
17. By abstaining from pleasures, we develop self-control, and once we have it, we can abstain better.
18. By facing fears, we become brave, and once brave, we can face fears better.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified version of the passage in modern language:

### Chapter II (continued)

1. To test if habits are formed, we should look at the pleasure or pain that follows actions.
2. A person with self-mastery not only avoids bodily pleasures but is happy to do so.
3. Someone who avoids pleasures but is unhappy about it does not have self-mastery.
4. A brave person faces danger with pleasure or at least without pain.
5. Someone who faces danger with pain is not truly brave.
6. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains because we do bad things for pleasure and avoid good things because of pain.
7. Plato said that people should be trained from childhood to feel pleasure and pain from the right things, which is proper education.
8. Virtues involve actions and feelings, and every action and feeling is followed by pleasure or pain.
9. This shows that virtue is connected to pleasure and pain.
10. Punishments use pleasure and pain because they are like remedies that cure bad behavior.
11. Every habit of the soul relates to things that can improve or worsen it, like pleasures and pains.
12. Bad habits come from pursuing or avoiding pleasures and pains in the wrong way, at the wrong time, or in the wrong manner.
13. Some people wrongly define virtues as states of being unaffected by anything, but they should add "in the right way" or "at the right time."
14. Virtue is the habit that deals with pleasures and pains in the best way, while vice is the opposite.
15. Three things move us to choose or avoid: the honorable, the useful, and the pleasant, and their opposites: the dishonorable, the harmful, and the painful.
16. Good people make the right choices regarding these, especially pleasure, which is common to all animals and hard to remove from our lives.
17. We often measure actions by pleasure and pain, so it's important to get these feelings right.
18. It's harder to fight against pleasure than anger, and virtue deals with difficult things.
19. Virtue and moral philosophy focus on pleasures and pains because using them well makes us good, and using them badly makes us bad.
20. Virtue is about pleasures and pains and is formed, increased, or ruined by the same circumstances.

### Chapter III

1. Some might be confused by the idea that we must do just actions to become just and self-controlled actions to become self-controlled.
2. They might think that if we do these actions, we already have the virtues, like being a grammarian or musician by doing their actions.
3. But this is not true even for arts because someone might do something grammatical by chance or suggestion, not by their own knowledge.
4. A grammarian does grammatical things because of their own knowledge.
5. Arts and virtues are different because the excellence of arts is in the product, but virtues are in the actions and the state of the person doing them.
6. Virtuous actions must be done knowingly, with deliberate choice, and for their own sake, and the person must be stable in their character.
7. For arts, only knowledge is needed, but for virtues, knowledge is not enough; the other conditions are essential.
8. These conditions come from repeatedly doing just and self-controlled actions.
9. Actions are called virtuous when they are like those of a just or self-controlled person.
10. A person is not virtuous just by doing these actions but by doing them in the way a virtuous person would.
11. Virtues are formed by doing the actions, but not doing them means not becoming good.
12. Many people talk about virtue but do not practice it, like sick people who listen to a doctor but do not follow the advice.
13. Just as these people cannot get healthy, those who only talk about virtue cannot become good.

### Chapter IV

1. Next, we need to examine what virtue is.
2. Things in the mind are of three kinds: feelings, capacities, and states.
3. Feelings include lust, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, friendship, hatred, longing, emulation, and compassion, all followed by pleasure or pain.
4. Capacities are what make us capable of these feelings, like being able to get angry or feel compassion.
5. States are how we relate to these feelings, like being too angry or not angry enough, or being in the right balance.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified version of the passage in modern language:

### Chapter IV (continued)

1. Feelings are not virtues or vices because we are not called good or bad based on our feelings, but we are based on our virtues and vices.
2. We are not praised or blamed for having feelings like fear or anger, but for how we handle them.
3. Feelings like anger and fear happen without moral choice, while virtues involve moral choice.
4. Feelings move us, but virtues and vices are about being disposed in a certain way.
5. Capacities are not virtues or vices either because we are not called good or bad just for having the ability to feel.
6. Capacities are natural, but we do not become good or bad by nature.
7. Therefore, virtues are not feelings or capacities; they must be states.

### Chapter V

1. We have said that virtue is a state, but we need to explain what kind of state it is.
2. Excellence makes something good and helps it perform its function well.
3. For example, the excellence of the eye makes it good and helps it see well.
4. The excellence of a horse makes it good at running, carrying a rider, and facing the enemy.
5. Similarly, human virtue is a state that makes a person good and helps them perform their proper function well.
6. In any quantity, whether continuous or discrete, there is a greater part, a lesser part, and an equal part.
7. The equal part is a mean between excess and defect.
8. The absolute mean is equidistant from both extremes and is the same for everyone.
9. The relative mean is what is neither too much nor too little for a particular person.
10. For example, if ten is too much and two is too little, six is the absolute mean.
11. But the relative mean depends on the individual; for one person, six might be too much, and for another, too little.
12. Skilled people avoid excess and defect and choose the mean relative to themselves.
13. All skills aim at the mean to perform well.
14. Good artisans work with an eye on the mean, and excellence is more precise and better than any art.
15. Moral excellence, or virtue, is concerned with feelings and actions, which can have excess, defect, and a mean.
16. For example, we can feel fear, confidence, lust, anger, compassion, and pleasure too much or too little, and either way is wrong.
17. The right way is to feel these emotions at the right time, towards the right people, for the right reasons, and in the right manner.
18. Virtue is about finding and adopting the mean in feelings and actions.
19. Virtue is a mean state because it aims at the mean.
20. It is easy to go wrong in many ways but hard to get it right, which is why excess and defect belong to vice, and the mean belongs to virtue.

### Chapter VI

1. Virtue is a state that involves deliberate choice, aiming at the relative mean, determined by reason, as a wise person would determine.
2. It is a middle state between two faulty extremes: excess and defect.
3. Faulty states either fall short of or exceed what is right in feelings and actions.
4. Virtue finds and adopts the mean.
5. In essence, virtue is a mean state, but in terms of the highest good, it is the best state.
6. Not every action or feeling can have a mean state because some are inherently bad, like malice, shamelessness, envy, adultery, theft, and murder.
7. These actions are always wrong, regardless of the circumstances.
8. You cannot have a mean state, excess, or defect in actions that are inherently wrong.
9. Just as self-mastery and courage have no excess or defect, inherently bad actions have no mean state.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: ### Chapter V (continued)

1. It's not enough to talk about virtues in general; we need to look at specific examples.
2. General statements can seem vague, but detailed ones feel more real.
3. Actions are specific, so general statements must apply to these specifics to be useful.
4. Let's look at specific examples from a well-known scheme.

#### I. Fear and Confidence
- The mean state is **Courage**.
- Too little fear or too much confidence is called **Rashness**.
- Too much fear or too little confidence is called **Cowardice**.

#### II. Pleasures and Pains
- The mean state is **Self-Mastery**.
- The excess is **Lack of Self-Control**.
- There is no real name for the defect because it's rare, but we can call it **Insensibility**.

#### III. Giving and Taking Wealth (a)
- The mean state is **Liberality**.
- The excess is **Prodigality** (giving too much, taking too little).
- The defect is **Stinginess** (taking too much, giving too little).

#### IV. Wealth (b)
- The mean state is **Munificence** (dealing with great wealth).
- The excess is **Vulgar Profusion** or **Lack of Taste**.
- The defect is **Paltriness**.

#### V. Honor and Dishonor (a)
- The mean state is **Greatness of Soul**.
- The excess is **Vanity**.
- The defect is **Smallness of Soul**.

#### VI. Honor and Dishonor (b)
- The mean state for small honors is similar to **Greatness of Soul** but for smaller things.
- The excess is **Ambition**.
- The defect is **Unambitiousness**.
- The virtuous state has no specific name, but we sometimes call it ambitious or unambitious.

#### VII. Anger
- The mean state is **Meekness**.
- The excess is **Passionateness**.
- The defect is **Angerlessness**.

#### VIII. Interpersonal Interactions
- **Truthfulness**: The mean state is **Truthfulness**. The excess is **Braggadocia** (exaggeration), and the defect is **Reserve** (understatement).
- **Pleasantness in Amusement**: The mean state is **Easy-Pleasantry**. The excess is **Buffoonery**, and the defect is **Clownishness**.
- **Pleasantness in Daily Life**: The mean state is **Friendliness**. The excess is **Complaisance** (without motive) or **Flattery** (with motive), and the defect is **Quarrelsomeness** or **Crossness**.

#### IX. Feelings
- **Shame**: The mean state is **Shamefacedness**. The excess is **Overwhelmed with Shame**, and the defect is **Shamelessness**.
- **Indignation**: The mean state is **Indignation** (annoyed at undeserved success). The excess is **Envy** (annoyed at all success), and the defect is **Malevolence** (rejoicing at others' misfortune).

### Chapter VIII

1. We will discuss these virtues and their mean states in detail later.
2. We will also talk about the intellectual virtues.

I hope this breakdown helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
Sent by Copilot: ### Chapter VIII

1. There are three states in each case: two faulty (excess and defect) and one right (the mean).
2. These states are opposed to each other: the extremes oppose the mean and each other.
3. For example, the brave person seems rash to the coward and cowardly to the rash person.
4. Similarly, the self-controlled person seems indulgent to the insensible and insensible to the indulgent.
5. The liberal person seems prodigal to the stingy and stingy to the prodigal.
6. Extremes push the mean state towards each other, making the mean seem like the opposite extreme.
7. The opposition between extremes is greater than between either extreme and the mean.
8. Some extremes resemble the mean more than others, like rashness to courage and prodigality to liberality.
9. The further apart things are, the more contrary they are.
10. Sometimes the excess is more opposed to the mean, and sometimes the defect is.
11. For courage, cowardice (defect) is more opposed than rashness (excess).
12. For self-mastery, lack of self-control (excess) is more opposed than insensibility (defect).
13. This is because one extreme is closer to the mean and resembles it more.
14. We have a natural bias towards pleasure, making us more inclined to lack self-control than to self-discipline.
15. Therefore, lack of self-control is more contrary to self-mastery than insensibility is.

### Chapter IX

1. Moral virtue is a mean state between two faulty states: excess and defect.
2. It aims at the mean in both feelings and actions.
3. It is hard to be good because finding the mean is difficult, like finding the center of a circle.
4. Anyone can get angry, give money, or spend, but doing these in the right way is hard.
5. Goodness is rare, praiseworthy, and noble because it is difficult.
6. To aim at the mean, avoid the extreme that is more contrary to the mean.
7. Like Ulysses avoiding the smoke and surge, avoid the greater error.
8. Since hitting the exact mean is hard, choose the lesser of two evils.
9. Consider your natural bias, which varies for each person.
10. Force yourself in the opposite direction to correct your bias, like straightening bent timber.
11. Be cautious of pleasure because we are not impartial judges of it.
12. Treat pleasure like the old counselors treated Helen, sending it away to avoid error.
13. These precautions help us attain the mean.
14. It is difficult to determine exactly how to act in specific situations.
15. We sometimes praise people for being too meek or too spirited.
16. Small deviations from the mean are not blamed, only significant ones.
17. It is hard to determine the exact point of blame in words; it is a matter of moral sense.
18. The mean state is praiseworthy, and we should aim for it by sometimes leaning towards excess and sometimes towards defect.
