Sent by Copilot: Sure, I can help with that! Here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of Aristotle's text in modern language:

**Chapter I:**

1. Human excellence is of two kinds: intellectual and moral.
2. Intellectual excellence comes from teaching and requires experience and time.
3. Moral excellence comes from habit, which is why the Greek word for it is related to the word for habit.
4. Moral virtues are not in us by nature because things that exist by nature cannot be changed by habit.
5. For example, a stone naturally falls down and cannot be trained to go up.
6. Virtues are not in us by nature, but we have the capacity to develop them through habit.
7. We first have the ability to do things by nature, then we perform the actions.
8. For example, we have senses like sight and hearing before we use them.
9. Virtues are developed by performing actions, just like skills are learned by practicing.
10. For example, we become builders by building and harp players by playing the harp.
11. By doing just actions, we become just; by doing self-controlled actions, we become self-controlled; by doing brave actions, we become brave.
12. Lawmakers make people good by habituating them to good actions.
13. Virtues are produced and destroyed by the same actions, just like skills.
14. Good and bad harp players are made by playing the harp well or badly.
15. The same applies to builders and other skills.
16. Virtues are developed by acting in various situations with other people.
17. By acting in dangerous situations, we become brave or cowardly.
18. By acting in situations of desire and anger, we become self-controlled or uncontrolled.
19. Habits are formed by actions, so we must perform the right actions to develop good habits.
20. How we are trained from childhood makes a big difference in our character.

**Chapter II:**

1. The goal of this treatise is not just to know what virtue is, but to become virtuous.
2. We must consider how to perform actions because the quality of our habits depends on them.
3. Acting according to right reason is a general rule, which we will discuss later.
4. Moral actions cannot be precisely defined because they depend on the situation.
5. Just like health, moral actions do not have fixed rules.
6. Each situation must be judged individually, like in medicine or navigation.
7. Excess and deficiency spoil virtues, just like they spoil health.
8. For example, too much or too little exercise can harm strength.
9. The same applies to food and drink for health.
10. Virtues like self-control and courage are spoiled by excess and deficiency but preserved by the right amount.
11. Habits are formed and maintained by the same actions.
12. Strength is gained by eating well and exercising, and maintained by the same actions.
13. Virtues are developed by abstaining from pleasures and facing fears.
14. Once we have virtues, we can best maintain them by continuing the right actions.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the passage in modern language:

**Chapter II:**

1. To test if habits are formed, we should look at the pleasure or pain that follows actions.
2. A person with self-mastery not only avoids bodily pleasures but is happy to do so.
3. Someone who avoids pleasures but is unhappy about it does not have self-mastery.
4. A brave person faces danger with pleasure or at least without pain.
5. Someone who faces danger with pain is not truly brave.
6. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains because we do bad things for pleasure and avoid good things because of pain.
7. Plato said that people should be trained from childhood to feel pleasure and pain from the right things, which is proper education.
8. Virtues involve actions and feelings, and every action and feeling is followed by pleasure or pain.
9. This shows that virtue is related to pleasure and pain.
10. Punishments work through pleasure and pain because they are like remedies that counteract the bad.
11. Every habit of the soul is related to things that can improve or worsen it, like pleasures and pains.
12. Habits become bad when people pursue or avoid pleasures and pains in the wrong way, at the wrong time, or in the wrong manner.
13. Some people wrongly define virtues as states of being unaffected by anything, but they should add "in the right way" or "at the right time."
14. Virtue is the habit that deals with pleasures and pains in the best way, while vice is the opposite.
15. Three things move us to choose or avoid: the honorable, the useful, and the pleasant, and their opposites: the dishonorable, the harmful, and the painful.
16. Good people make the right choices about these things, especially pleasure, which is common to all animals and hard to remove from our lives.
17. We often measure actions by pleasure and pain, so it's important to get these feelings right.
18. It's harder to fight against pleasure than anger, and virtue deals with difficult things.
19. Virtue and moral philosophy focus on pleasures and pains because using them well makes us good, and using them badly makes us bad.
20. Virtue is related to pleasures and pains and is formed and maintained by the same actions that created it.

**Chapter III:**

1. Some might be confused by the idea that we must do just actions to become just and self-controlled actions to become self-controlled.
2. They might think that if we do these actions, we already have the virtues, like being a grammarian or musician by doing their actions.
3. But even in arts, a person might do something grammatical by chance or suggestion, not because they are a grammarian.
4. A grammarian does grammatical things because of their knowledge.
5. Arts and virtues are different because the products of arts have their excellence in themselves.
6. Virtuous actions are not just about the actions themselves but also about the state of the person doing them.
7. A person must know what they are doing, choose to do it deliberately, and be stable in their actions to have virtues.
8. Knowledge alone is not enough for virtues; the other conditions are crucial.
9. These conditions come from repeatedly doing just and self-controlled actions.
10. Actions are called virtuous when they are like those of a just or self-controlled person.
11. A person is not virtuous just by doing these actions but by doing them in the right way.
12. Virtues are formed by doing the actions, but not doing them means not becoming good.
13. Many people talk about virtues but do not practice them, like sick people who listen to a doctor but do not follow their advice.
14. Just as these people cannot get healthy, those who only talk about virtues cannot become good.

**Chapter IV:**

1. Next, we need to examine what virtue is.
2. Things in the mind are of three kinds: feelings, capacities, and states.
3. Virtue must belong to one of these three classes.
4. Feelings include lust, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, friendship, hatred, longing, emulation, and compassion, all followed by pleasure or pain.
5. Capacities are what make us capable of these feelings, like being able to feel anger or compassion.
6. States are how we relate to these feelings, like being too angry or not angry enough.
7. Being in the right state means having the right amount of these feelings.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further clarification or have more questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the passage in modern language:

**Chapter IV:**

1. Feelings are not virtues or vices because we are not called good or bad based on our feelings, but on our virtues and vices.
2. We are not praised or blamed for our feelings, but for how we handle them.
3. For example, we are not praised for being afraid or angry, but for being afraid or angry in the right way.
4. Feelings like anger and fear happen without moral choice, while virtues involve moral choice.
5. Feelings move us, but virtues and vices are about being disposed in a certain way.
6. Capacities are not virtues or vices either because we are not called good or bad just for having the ability to feel.
7. Capacities are natural, but we do not become good or bad by nature.
8. Therefore, virtues are not feelings or capacities, but states.

**Chapter V:**

1. We have said that virtue is a state, but we need to explain what kind of state it is.
2. Excellence makes something good and helps it perform its function well.
3. For example, the excellence of the eye makes it good and helps it see well.
4. The excellence of a horse makes it good at running, carrying a rider, and facing the enemy.
5. Similarly, the excellence of a person, or virtue, makes a person good and helps them perform their function well.
6. Virtue is a state that helps a person be good and perform well.
7. In all things, there is a greater part, a lesser part, and an equal part, which is the mean between excess and defect.
8. The absolute mean is equidistant from both extremes and is the same for everyone.
9. The mean relative to us is what is neither too much nor too little for each individual.
10. For example, if ten is too much and two is too little, six is the absolute mean.
11. But the mean relative to us depends on the individual, like how much food or exercise is right for each person.
12. Skilled people avoid excess and defect and choose the mean relative to themselves.
13. All skills aim at the mean to perform well.
14. Virtue, like nature, aims at the mean and is better than any art.
15. Virtue deals with feelings and actions, which can have excess, defect, and the mean.
16. Feeling emotions like fear, confidence, lust, anger, compassion, and pleasure too much or too little is wrong.
17. Feeling them at the right time, in the right way, and towards the right people is the mean and is virtuous.
18. Actions can also have excess, defect, and the mean.
19. Virtue is concerned with feelings and actions, where the mean is praised and goes right.
20. Virtue is a mean state because it aims at the mean.
21. It is easy to go wrong in many ways, but hard to go right in one way.
22. Therefore, excess and defect belong to vice, and the mean belongs to virtue.

**Chapter VI:**

1. Virtue is a state that involves deliberate choice, aiming at the mean as determined by reason and practical wisdom.
2. It is a middle state between two faulty ones, excess and defect.
3. Faulty states fall short of or exceed what is right, while virtue finds and adopts the mean.
4. Virtue is a mean state in essence but the highest state in terms of goodness and excellence.
5. Not every action or feeling can have a mean state because some are inherently bad, like malevolence, shamelessness, envy, adultery, theft, and homicide.
6. These actions are always wrong, regardless of the person, time, or manner.
7. You cannot have a mean state, excess, or defect in inherently bad actions.
8. Just as self-mastery and courage have no excess or defect, inherently bad actions have no mean state.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further clarification or have more questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the passage in modern language:

**Chapter VII:**

1. It's not enough to talk about virtues in general terms; we need to look at specific examples.
2. General statements can seem vague, but detailed ones feel more real.
3. Actions must be specific, and general statements must apply to these specifics to be useful.
4. Let's look at specific examples from a well-known scheme.

**I. In respect of fears and confidence:**
1. The mean state is courage.
2. Too little fear or too much confidence is called rashness.
3. Too much fear and too little confidence is called cowardice.

**II. In respect of pleasures and pains:**
1. The mean state is self-mastery.
2. The defect is a total lack of self-control.
3. There are no people who lack pleasure, so we call them insensible.

**III. In respect of giving and taking wealth (a):**
1. The mean state is liberality.
2. The excess is prodigality, and the defect is stinginess.
3. Prodigal people give too much and take too little, while stingy people take too much and give too little.

**IV. In respect of wealth (b):**
1. Another mean state is munificence, which deals with great wealth.
2. The excess is vulgar profusion, and the defect is paltriness.
3. These differ from the extremes connected with liberality.

**V. In respect of honor and dishonor (a):**
1. The mean state is greatness of soul.
2. The excess is called vanity, and the defect is littleness of soul.

**VI. In respect of honor and dishonor (b):**
1. A state related to greatness of soul is ambition.
2. Excessive ambition is called ambitious, and the lack of it is unambitious.
3. The virtuous character sometimes seems ambitious and sometimes unambitious.

**VII. In respect of anger:**
1. The mean state is meekness.
2. The excess is called passionateness, and the defect is called angerlessness.

**Other mean states:**
1. In respect of truth: The mean state is truthfulness, the excess is braggadocia, and the defect is reserve.
2. In respect of what is pleasant in relaxation: The mean state is easy-pleasantry, the excess is buffoonery, and the defect is clownishness.
3. In respect of what is pleasant in daily life: The mean state is friendliness, the excess is complaisance or flattery, and the defect is quarrelsomeness or crossness.

**Feelings and matters concerning them:**
1. Shamefacedness is not a virtue, but a man is praised for being shamefaced.
2. The excess is being dumbfounded, and the defect is shamelessness.
3. Indignation against successful vice is a mean state between envy and malevolence.
4. The right feeling is being annoyed at undeserved success, while envy is being annoyed at all success, and malevolence is rejoicing at others' misfortune.

**Conclusion:**
1. We will discuss these in more detail later, including justice and intellectual excellences.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further clarification or have more questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the passage in modern language:

**Chapter VIII:**

1. There are three states in each case: two faulty (excess and defect) and one right (the mean).
2. All these states are opposed to one another.
3. The extremes are opposed to the mean and to each other.
4. The mean is greater than the defect and less than the excess.
5. For example, a brave person seems rash compared to a coward and cowardly compared to a rash person.
6. A self-controlled person seems uncontrolled compared to an insensible person and insensible compared to an uncontrolled person.
7. A liberal person seems prodigal compared to a stingy person and stingy compared to a prodigal person.
8. Extreme characters push the person in the mean state towards each other.
9. The brave person is called rash by the coward and cowardly by the rash person.
10. The contrariety between the extremes is greater than between either extreme and the mean.
11. Some extremes resemble the mean, like rashness to courage and prodigality to liberality.
12. The greatest dissimilarity is between the extremes.
13. Things furthest from each other are the most contrary.
14. In some cases, the excess is more opposed to the mean, and in others, the defect is more opposed.
15. For courage, cowardice (the defect) is more opposed than rashness (the excess).
16. For self-mastery, lack of self-control (the excess) is more opposed than insensibility (the defect).
17. One reason is that one extreme is nearer and more like the mean.
18. Another reason is our natural bias towards certain things, like pleasure.
19. We are more inclined to reject self-control than to embrace self-discipline.
20. Therefore, lack of self-control is more contrary to self-mastery than insensibility.

**Chapter IX:**

1. Moral virtue is a mean state between two faulty states (excess and defect).
2. It aims at the mean in feelings and actions.
3. It is hard to be good because finding the mean is difficult.
4. Just as finding the center of a circle requires skill, so does finding the mean in actions and feelings.
5. Anyone can be angry, give money, or be generous, but doing these in the right way is difficult.
6. Goodness is rare, praiseworthy, and noble because it is hard to achieve.
7. To aim at the mean, one should avoid the extreme that is more contrary to the mean.
8. Like Ulysses avoiding the smoke and surge, one should steer clear of the greater error.
9. Since hitting the mean exactly is difficult, one should choose the lesser evil.
10. Consider your natural bias, which varies for each person.
11. Force yourself in the opposite direction to find the mean, like straightening bent timber.
12. Guard against what is pleasant because we are not impartial judges of pleasure.
13. Treat pleasure like the old counselors treated Helen, sending it away to avoid error.
14. These precautions help us attain the mean.
15. It is difficult to determine exactly how to feel anger, with whom, for what reasons, and for how long.
16. We sometimes praise those who are meek and call hot-tempered people spirited.
17. Small deviations from the mean are not blamed, only significant ones.
18. It is hard to determine the exact point at which blame is incurred.
19. These questions are matters of detail and are decided by the moral sense.
20. The mean state is praiseworthy, and we must sometimes lean towards excess or defect to find it.
