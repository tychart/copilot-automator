Sent by Copilot: Sure, I can help with that! Here’s a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of Aristotle's text in modern language:

**Chapter I:**

1. Human excellence is of two kinds: intellectual and moral.
2. Intellectual excellence comes from teaching and requires experience and time.
3. Moral excellence comes from habit, which is why the Greek word for it is related to the word for habit.
4. Moral virtues are not in us by nature because natural things can't be changed by habit.
5. For example, a stone naturally falls down and can't be trained to go up.
6. Virtues are not in us by nature, but we have the capacity to develop them through habit.
7. We first have the ability to do things by nature, and then we perform actions.
8. For example, we have senses like sight and hearing before we use them.
9. But we develop virtues by first performing actions, like learning to build by building.
10. By doing just actions, we become just; by doing brave actions, we become brave.
11. Lawmakers make people good by habituation, which is the goal of every lawmaker.
12. Virtues are produced or destroyed by the same actions, just like arts.
13. For example, good and bad harp players are made by playing the harp.
14. Similarly, builders become good or bad by building well or poorly.
15. If this weren't true, we wouldn't need teachers, and everyone would be good or bad naturally.
16. By acting in different situations, we become just or unjust, brave or cowardly.
17. By behaving in certain ways, we develop habits, like self-control or lack of it.
18. Habits are formed from actions, so we need to focus on our actions.
19. How we are trained from childhood makes a big difference in our habits.

**Chapter II:**

1. The goal of this treatise is not just to know what virtue is, but to become virtuous.
2. We need to consider how to perform actions because habits depend on them.
3. Acting according to right reason is a general rule, which we will discuss later.
4. Moral actions can't be described exactly because they depend on the situation.
5. Just like health, moral actions don't have fixed rules and depend on individual cases.
6. We must try to do our best even though the subject is complex.
7. Virtues are spoiled by excess and deficiency, like health and strength.
8. For example, too much or too little exercise can harm strength.
9. Similarly, too much or too little food can harm health.
10. Virtues like self-control and courage are preserved by the right balance.
11. Excessive fear makes a person a coward, while no fear makes a person rash.
12. Tasting every pleasure leads to lack of self-control, while avoiding all pleasures dulls perception.
13. Virtues are developed by the right balance of actions.
14. The same actions that create virtues also maintain them.
15. For example, strength comes from eating well and exercising, and strong people can do these best.
16. Similarly, by abstaining from pleasures, we develop self-control.
17. By facing fears, we become brave, and brave people can best face fears.

Sent by Copilot: Sure, here’s a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the passage in modern language:

**Chapter II (continued):**

1. To test if habits are formed, we should look at the pleasure or pain that follows actions.
2. A person with self-control not only avoids bodily pleasures but is happy to do so.
3. Someone who avoids pleasures but is unhappy about it does not have self-control.
4. A brave person faces danger with pleasure or at least without pain.
5. Someone who faces danger with pain is not truly brave.
6. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains because we do bad things for pleasure and avoid good things because of pain.
7. Plato said that people should be trained from childhood to feel pleasure and pain from the right things, which is proper education.
8. Virtues involve actions and feelings, and pleasure and pain follow every action and feeling.
9. This shows that virtue is connected to pleasure and pain.
10. Punishments use pleasure and pain because they are like remedies that counteract bad behavior.
11. Every habit of the soul relates to things that can improve or worsen it, like pleasures and pains.
12. Bad habits form when people pursue or avoid pleasures and pains in the wrong way, at the wrong time, or in the wrong manner.
13. Some people wrongly define virtues as states of being unaffected by anything, but they should add "in the right way" and "at the right time."
14. Virtue is the habit that produces the best results in relation to pleasures and pains, while vice does the opposite.
15. Three things move us to choose or avoid actions: the honorable, the useful, and the pleasant, and their opposites: the dishonorable, the harmful, and the painful.
16. Good people make the right choices, especially regarding pleasure, which is common to all animals and accompanies all choices.
17. Pleasure grows with us from infancy, making it hard to remove from our lives.
18. We often use pleasure and pain as measures for our actions.
19. Therefore, dealing with pleasure and pain is crucial for our actions.
20. It is harder to fight against pleasure than anger, and virtue involves dealing with difficult things.
21. Virtue and moral philosophy focus on pleasures and pains because using them well makes a person good, and using them poorly makes a person bad.
22. Virtue deals with pleasures and pains and is either strengthened or weakened by the same circumstances that created it.

**Chapter III:**

1. Some might be confused by the idea that we must do just actions to become just and self-controlled actions to become self-controlled.
2. They might think that if we do these actions, we already have the virtues, like being a grammarian or musician by doing their actions.
3. But this is not true even for arts because someone might do something grammatical by chance or suggestion, not by their own knowledge.
4. A person is a grammarian only when they produce grammatical work by their own knowledge.
5. Arts and virtues are different because the excellence of arts is in the product, while virtues are in the actions and the state of the person doing them.
6. Virtuous actions must be done knowingly, with deliberate choice, and for their own sake, and the person must be stable in their character.
7. For arts, only knowledge is needed, but for virtues, knowledge is not enough; the other conditions are crucial.
8. These conditions come from repeatedly doing just and self-controlled actions.
9. Actions are called just or self-controlled when they are like those a just or self-controlled person would do.
10. A person is not virtuous just by doing these actions but by doing them in the way a virtuous person would.
11. Virtues are formed by doing the actions, but not doing them means one cannot become good.
12. Many people talk about virtue but do not practice it, like patients who listen to a doctor but do not follow their advice.
13. Just as these patients cannot get healthy, people cannot become virtuous by just talking about it.

**Chapter IV:**

1. Next, we need to examine what virtue is.
2. Things in the mind are of three kinds: feelings, capacities, and states.
3. Feelings include emotions like lust, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, friendship, hatred, longing, emulation, and compassion.
4. Capacities are our abilities to feel these emotions.
5. States are our good or bad relations to these feelings, like being too angry or not angry enough.
6. Virtue must belong to one of these three classes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here’s a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the passage in modern language:

**Chapter IV (continued):**

1. Feelings are not virtues or vices because we are not called good or bad based on our feelings, but on our virtues and vices.
2. We are not praised or blamed for our feelings, but for our virtues and vices.
3. For example, we are not praised for being afraid or angry, but for how we handle these feelings.
4. Feelings like anger and fear happen without moral choice, while virtues involve moral choice.
5. Feelings move us, but virtues and vices are about being disposed in a certain way.
6. Capacities are not virtues or vices either because we are not called good or bad just for having the ability to feel.
7. Capacities are natural, but we do not become good or bad by nature.
8. Since virtues are neither feelings nor capacities, they must be states.

**Chapter V:**

1. We have said that virtue is a state, but we need to explain what kind of state it is.
2. All excellence makes something good and helps it perform its function well.
3. For example, the excellence of the eye makes it good and helps it see well.
4. The excellence of a horse makes it good at running, carrying a rider, and facing the enemy.
5. Similarly, the excellence of a person, or virtue, makes a person good and helps them perform their function well.
6. Virtue is a state that makes a person good and helps them perform their proper work.
7. In all quantities, there is a greater part, a lesser part, and an equal part, which is the mean.
8. The absolute mean is equidistant from both extremes and is the same for everyone.
9. The relative mean is what is neither too much nor too little for a particular person.
10. For example, if ten is too much and two is too little, six is the absolute mean.
11. But the relative mean depends on the individual; for one person, six might be too much, and for another, too little.
12. Skilled people avoid excess and defect and choose the mean relative to themselves.
13. All skills aim at the mean to perform well.
14. Good artisans work with an eye on the mean, and excellence aims at the mean.
15. Moral excellence, or virtue, is concerned with feelings and actions, which can have excess, defect, and a mean.
16. Virtue involves feeling emotions like fear, confidence, lust, anger, compassion, and pleasure in the right amount, at the right time, towards the right people, for the right reasons.
17. Virtue is about finding the mean in feelings and actions, which is praised and correct.
18. Virtue is a mean state because it aims at the mean.
19. It is easy to go wrong in many ways but hard to go right in one way.
20. Therefore, excess and defect belong to vice, and the mean state belongs to virtue.

**Chapter VI:**

1. Virtue is a state that involves deliberate choice, aiming at the relative mean, determined by reason, as a wise person would determine.
2. It is a middle state between two faulty ones, excess and defect.
3. Faulty states fall short of or exceed what is right, while virtue finds and adopts the mean.
4. Virtue is a mean state in essence but the highest state in terms of goodness and excellence.
5. Not every action or feeling can have a mean state because some are inherently bad, like malevolence, shamelessness, envy, adultery, theft, and homicide.
6. These actions are always wrong, regardless of the amount or manner.
7. You cannot have a mean state, excess, or defect in inherently bad actions.
8. Just as self-mastery and courage have no excess or defect, inherently bad actions have no mean state, excess, or defect.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here’s a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the passage in modern language:

**Chapter VII:**

1. It's not enough to talk about virtues in general; we need to look at specific examples.
2. General statements can seem vague, but detailed examples make them clearer.

2. In respect of what is pleasant in relaxation: The mean state is easy-pleasantry, the excess is buffoonery, and the defect is clownishness.
3. In respect of what is pleasant in daily life: The mean state is friendliness, the excess is complaisance or flattery, and the defect is quarrelsomeness or crossness.

**Feelings and matters concerning them:**

1. Shamefacedness is not a virtue but is praised.
2. The excess is being overwhelmed with shame.
3. The defect is shamelessness.

1. We will discuss these in more detail later.
2. We will also discuss justice and intellectual excellences.

Sent by Copilot: Sure, here’s a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the passage in modern language:

**Chapter VIII:**

1. There are three states in each case: two faulty (excess and defect) and one right (the mean).
2. These states are opposed to each other: the extremes oppose the mean and each other.
3. For example, the brave person seems rash compared to the coward and cowardly compared to the rash person.
4. Similarly, the self-controlled person seems uncontrolled compared to the insensible person and insensible compared to the uncontrolled person.
5. The liberal person seems prodigal compared to the stingy person and stingy compared to the prodigal person.
6. The extremes push the person in the mean state towards each other.
7. The brave person is called rash by the coward and cowardly by the rash person.
8. The opposition between extremes is greater than between either extreme and the mean.
9. Some extremes resemble the mean, like rashness to courage and prodigality to liberality.
10. The greatest dissimilarity is between the extremes.
11. Things furthest from each other are the most contrary.
12. Sometimes the excess is more opposed to the mean, and sometimes the defect is.
13. For courage, cowardice (defect) is more opposed than rashness (excess).
14. For self-mastery, lack of self-control (excess) is more opposed than insensibility (defect).
15. One reason is that one extreme is closer to the mean and resembles it more.
16. Another reason is our natural bias; we are more inclined towards pleasure, so lack of self-control is more opposed to self-mastery.

**Chapter IX:**

1. Moral virtue is a mean state between two faulty states (excess and defect).
2. It aims at the mean in feelings and actions.
3. It is hard to be good because finding the mean is difficult.
4. Being angry, giving money, and being generous are easy, but doing these in the right way is hard.
5. Goodness is rare, praiseworthy, and noble.
6. To aim at the mean, avoid the extreme that is more contrary to it.
7. Like Ulysses avoiding the smoke and surge, avoid the greater error.
8. Since hitting the mean is difficult, choose the lesser evil.
9. Consider your natural bias, which varies for each person.
10. Force yourself in the opposite direction to find the mean.
11. Guard against pleasure because we are not impartial judges of it.
12. Treat pleasure like the old counselors treated Helen, by sending it away to avoid error.
13. These precautions help us attain the mean.
14. It is difficult to determine exactly how to act in specific situations.
15. We sometimes praise those who are too meek or too hot-tempered.
16. Small deviations from the mean are not blamed, only large ones.
17. It is hard to determine the exact point of blame.
18. The mean state is praiseworthy, and we must sometimes lean towards excess or defect to find it.
