Sent by Copilot: Sure, I can help with that! Here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of Aristotle's text in modern language:

**Chapter I:**

1. Human excellence is of two kinds: intellectual and moral.
2. Intellectual excellence comes from teaching and requires experience and time.
3. Moral excellence comes from habit, which is why the Greek word for it is related to the word for habit.
4. Moral virtues are not in us by nature because natural things can't be changed by habit.
5. For example, a stone naturally falls down and can't be trained to go up.
6. Virtues are not in us by nature, but we have the capacity to develop them through habit.
7. We first have the ability to do things by nature, then we perform actions.
8. For example, we have senses like sight and hearing before we use them.
9. Virtues are developed by first performing actions, like learning to build by building.
10. By doing just actions, we become just; by doing brave actions, we become brave.
11. Lawmakers make people good by habituation, which is the goal of laws.
12. Virtues are created or destroyed by the same actions, like playing the harp well or badly.
13. By acting in certain ways, we become just or unjust, brave or cowardly.
14. Habits are formed by actions, so it's important to act in the right way from childhood.

**Chapter II:**

1. The goal of this treatise is not just to know what virtue is, but to become virtuous.
2. We must consider how to perform actions because habits depend on them.
3. Acting according to right reason is a general rule, which we will discuss later.
4. Moral actions can't be described exactly because they vary like matters of health.
5. Exactness isn't possible in particular cases, so individuals must judge each situation.
6. Things are spoiled by excess and deficiency, like health and strength.
7. For example, too much or too little food and exercise can harm health.
8. The same applies to virtues like self-mastery and courage.
9. Excessive fear makes a coward; no fear makes someone rash.
10. Tasting every pleasure leads to lack of self-control; avoiding all pleasures dulls perception.
11. Virtues are preserved by the right balance, not by excess or deficiency.
12. Habits are formed and maintained by the same actions.
13. Strength comes from eating well and exercising, and the strong can do these best.
14. Similarly, by abstaining from pleasures, we develop self-mastery and can best abstain.
15. By facing fears, we become brave and can best face fears.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the text in modern language:

**Chapter II:**

1. To test if habits are formed, we should look at the pleasure or pain that follows actions.
2. A person with self-mastery not only avoids bodily pleasures but is happy to do so.
3. Someone who avoids pleasures but is unhappy about it does not have self-mastery.
4. A brave person faces danger with pleasure or at least without pain.
5. Someone who faces danger with pain is not truly brave.
6. Moral virtue deals with pleasures and pains because we do bad things for pleasure and avoid good things because of pain.
7. Plato said that people should be trained from childhood to feel pleasure and pain from the right things.
8. Virtues involve actions and feelings, and every action and feeling is followed by pleasure or pain.
9. This shows that virtue is about managing pleasure and pain.
10. Punishments use pleasure and pain because they are like remedies that cure bad behavior.
11. Every habit of the soul relates to things that can improve or worsen it, like pleasures and pains.
12. Bad habits come from pursuing or avoiding pleasures and pains in the wrong way.
13. Some people wrongly define virtues as states of being unaffected by anything.
14. Virtue is the habit that manages pleasures and pains to achieve the best results, while vice does the opposite.
15. Three things move us to choose or avoid: the honorable, the useful, and the pleasant, and their opposites.
16. Good people make the right choices about these things, especially pleasure, which is common to all animals.
17. Pleasure grows with us from infancy and is hard to remove.
18. We often use pleasure and pain to measure our actions.
19. It's important to get the right impressions of pleasure and pain for our actions.
20. It's harder to fight against pleasure than anger, and virtue deals with difficult things.
21. Virtue and moral philosophy focus on pleasures and pains because using them well makes us good, and using them badly makes us bad.
22. Virtue deals with pleasures and pains and is formed and maintained by the same actions that created it.

**Chapter III:**

1. Some might be confused by the idea that we must do just actions to become just and self-mastery actions to gain self-mastery.
2. They might think that if we do these actions, we already have the virtues, like being a grammarian or musician by doing their actions.
3. But this isn't true even for arts because someone might do something grammatical by chance or suggestion.
4. A person is a grammarian when they produce grammatical work from their own knowledge.
5. Arts and virtues are different because arts produce things with excellence in themselves.
6. Virtues produce actions of a certain kind, like justice or self-mastery, not just by being in a certain state.
7. To have virtues, one must know what they are doing, choose to do it deliberately, and be stable in their actions.
8. For arts, only knowledge is needed, but for virtues, deliberate choice and stability are crucial.
9. Virtues come from repeatedly doing just and self-mastery actions.
10. Actions are called by the names of virtues when they are like what a just or self-mastering person would do.
11. A person has virtues not just by doing these actions but by doing them in the right way.
12. Virtues are formed by doing the actions, but not doing them means not becoming good.
13. Many people talk about virtues but don't practice them, like patients who listen to a doctor but don't follow advice.
14. Just as these patients can't get healthy, people can't become virtuous by just talking about it.

**Chapter IV:**

1. Next, we need to examine what virtue is.
2. Things in the mind are of three kinds: feelings, capacities, and states.
3. Feelings include emotions like lust, anger, fear, joy, and compassion.
4. Capacities are our abilities to feel these emotions.
5. States are our good or bad relations to these feelings, like being too angry or not angry enough.
6. Virtue must belong to one of these three classes.

Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the text in modern language:

**Chapter IV:**

1. Feelings are not virtues or vices because we are not called good or bad based on our feelings, but on our virtues and vices.
2. We are not praised or blamed for our feelings, but for how we handle them.
3. Feelings like anger and fear happen without moral choice, while virtues involve moral choice.
4. Feelings move us, but virtues and vices dispose us to act in certain ways.
5. Capacities are not virtues or vices because we are not called good or bad just for having the ability to feel.
6. Capacities are natural, but we do not become good or bad by nature.
7. Therefore, virtues are not feelings or capacities, but states.

**Chapter V:**

1. We have said that virtue is a state, but we need to explain what kind of state it is.
2. Excellence makes something good and helps it perform its function well.
3. For example, the excellence of the eye makes it see well.
4. The excellence of a horse makes it good at running, carrying a rider, and facing the enemy.
5. Similarly, human virtue is a state that makes a person good and helps them perform their function well.
6. In any quantity, there is a greater part, a lesser part, and an equal part, which is the mean.
7. The absolute mean is equidistant from both extremes and is the same for everyone.
8. The relative mean is what is neither too much nor too little for an individual.
9. For example, six is the absolute mean between ten and two, but it might not be the right amount for everyone.
10. Skilled people avoid excess and defect and aim for the mean.
11. Good artisans work with an eye on the mean, and excellence aims at the mean.
12. Moral excellence, or virtue, deals with feelings and actions, which can have excess, defect, or the mean.
13. Virtue involves feeling emotions like fear, confidence, and anger in the right amount, at the right time, and for the right reasons.
14. Virtue is praised for finding the mean, while excess and defect are blamed.
15. Virtue is a mean state because it aims at the mean.
16. It is easy to go wrong in many ways, but right in only one way.
17. Therefore, excess and defect belong to vice, and the mean state belongs to virtue.

**Chapter VI:**

1. Virtue is a state that involves deliberate choice, aiming at the relative mean as determined by reason and practical wisdom.
2. It is a middle state between two faulty extremes: excess and defect.
3. Virtue finds and adopts the mean in feelings and actions.
4. Virtue is a mean state in essence but the highest state in terms of goodness and excellence.
5. Not every action or feeling can have a mean state because some are inherently bad, like envy or theft.
6. These actions are always wrong, regardless of the circumstances.
7. Just as self-mastery and courage have no excess or defect, inherently bad actions have no mean state.
8. You cannot have a mean state of excess or defect, nor an excess or defect of a mean state.

Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the text in modern language:

**Chapter VIII:**

1. There are three states in each case: two faulty (excess and defect) and one right (the mean).
2. All these states are opposed to each other: the extremes to the mean and to each other, and the mean to the extremes.
3. For example, the brave person seems rash compared to the coward and cowardly compared to the rash person.
4. Similarly, a person with self-mastery seems uncontrolled compared to someone with no perception, and overly controlled compared to someone with no self-control.
5. A liberal person seems prodigal compared to a stingy person and stingy compared to a prodigal person.
6. Extreme characters push the person in the mean state towards each other.
7. The brave person is called rash by the coward and cowardly by the rash person.
8. The contrariety between the extremes is greater than between either extreme and the mean.
9. In some cases, an extreme resembles the mean, like rashness to courage and prodigality to liberality.
10. The greatest dissimilarity is between the extremes.
11. Things furthest from each other are defined as contrary, so the further off, the more contrary they are.
12. Sometimes the excess is more opposed to the mean, and sometimes the defect is.
13. For courage, cowardice (the defect) is more opposed than rashness (the excess).
14. For self-mastery, lack of self-control (the excess) is more opposed than insensibility (the defect).
15. One reason is that one extreme is nearer and more like the mean.
16. Another reason is our natural bias towards certain things, like pleasure.
17. We are more inclined to reject self-control than to embrace self-discipline.
18. Therefore, lack of self-control is more contrary to self-mastery than insensibility.

**Chapter IX:**

1. Moral virtue is a mean state between two faulty states: excess and defect.
2. It aims at the mean in both feelings and actions.

5. Anyone can be angry or give money, but doing these things in the right way is difficult.
6. Goodness is rare, praiseworthy, and noble because it is hard to achieve.
7. To aim at the mean, one should avoid the extreme that is more contrary to the mean.
8. Like Ulysses avoiding the smoke and surge, one should steer clear of the greater error.
9. Since hitting the exact mean is difficult, one should choose the lesser evil.
10. Consider your natural bias, which varies for each person.
11. Force yourself in the opposite direction to find the mean, like straightening bent timber.
