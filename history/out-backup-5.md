Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage from "Phaedo":

**Characters:**
- **Phaedo**: Narrator of the dialogue.
- **Echecrates**: Listener of the narration.
- **Socrates, Apollodorus, Simmias, Cebes, Crito**: Friends of Socrates.
- **Attendant of the Prison**: Prison staff.

**Scene:**
- **Location**: Socrates' prison.
- **Narration Place**: Phlius.

**Dialogue:**

1. **Echecrates**: Were you with Socrates when he drank the poison?
2. **Phaedo**: Yes, I was there.
3. **Echecrates**: I want to hear about his death. What did he say in his last hours? We know he died by poison, but we don't have details.
4. **Phaedo**: Didn't you hear about the trial?
5. **Echecrates**: Yes, but we don't understand why he was executed long after being condemned.
6. **Phaedo**: It was because the ship to Delos was crowned the day before his trial.
7. **Echecrates**: What ship is this?
8. **Phaedo**: It's the ship Theseus used to go to Crete. The Athenians vowed to send a yearly mission to Delos if they were saved. This tradition continues, and during this holy period, no executions are allowed.
9. **Echecrates**: How did he die? Who was with him? Were his friends allowed to be there?
10. **Phaedo**: Yes, several friends were with him.
11. **Echecrates**: Please tell me what happened.
12. **Phaedo**: I will. Remembering Socrates is always a pleasure for me.
13. **Echecrates**: We are eager to hear.
14. **Phaedo**: Being with him was strange. I didn't pity him because he died so fearlessly and nobly. I believed he was blessed and would be happy in the afterlife. But I felt both pleasure and pain because he was about to die. We were all emotional, especially Apollodorus.
15. **Echecrates**: Who else was there?
16. **Phaedo**: Besides Apollodorus, there were Critobulus, Crito, Hermogenes, Epigenes, Aeschines, Antisthenes, Ctesippus, Menexenus, and some others. Plato was ill.
17. **Echecrates**: Were there any strangers?
18. **Phaedo**: Yes, Simmias, Cebes, Phaedondes, Euclid, and Terpison.
19. **Echecrates**: Was Aristippus there?
20. **Phaedo**: No, they were in Aegina.
21. **Echecrates**: Anyone else?
22. **Phaedo**: I think that's all.
23. **Echecrates**: What did you talk about?
24. **Phaedo**: We met early at the court near the prison. We usually spent the day with Socrates. On the last morning, we heard the sacred ship had arrived, so we met early. The jailer told us to wait because the authorities were with Socrates, taking off his chains and preparing for his execution. When we entered, we found Socrates with Xanthippe, who was holding their child. She cried out, saying it was their last conversation. Socrates asked Crito to take her home. After she left, Socrates rubbed his leg and talked about how pleasure and pain are connected. He said Aesop would have made a fable about it.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: Evenus the poet asked me why I started writing poetry and turning Aesop's fables into verse while in prison. Tell him the truth, Cebes. I wasn't trying to compete with him. I had dreams throughout my life telling me to "make music." I thought it meant to study philosophy, which I did. But now, facing death, I wanted to be sure, so I wrote a hymn to Apollo and turned Aesop's fables into verse. Tell Evenus to be of good cheer and follow me if he's wise, as I will likely die today.

**Simmias**: Evenus won't take your advice unless he has to. Isn't he a philosopher?

**Socrates**: Yes, and a true philosopher will be willing to die but won't take his own life, as it's unlawful.

**Cebes**: Why shouldn't a man take his own life, but a philosopher be ready to die?

**Socrates**: Haven't you heard Philolaus speak of this? It's said that we are possessions of the gods, and we shouldn't end our lives without their command. It's like if one of your possessions died without your wish, you'd be angry. So, we should wait for the gods to summon us.

**Cebes**: That makes sense. But how can we reconcile this with the philosopher's willingness to die?

**Socrates**: A wise man knows that the gods take better care of him than he can himself. A fool might think he should run away from his master, but a wise man wants to stay with someone better than himself. So, a wise man should be willing to die, knowing he's going to a better place.

**Simmias**: This seems contradictory. Why would a wise man want to leave the gods who are good rulers?

**Socrates**: I understand your concern. But I believe I'm going to wise and good gods and better men than those here. So, I don't grieve at death, as I have hope for something better after life.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: Will you share your thoughts with us? It would benefit us all and help defend you. I'll try, but first, let me hear what Crito wants to say.

**Crito**: The attendant says you shouldn't talk much because it increases heat and might interfere with the poison's effect. You might need more doses if you get too excited.

**Socrates**: Let him do his job and be ready to give the poison as many times as needed. Now, my friends, I want to show you why a true philosopher should be cheerful about dying and hope for the greatest good after death. People don't understand that philosophers are always preparing for death. If they've desired death all their lives, why should they fear it when it comes?

**Simmias**: Your words might make people think philosophers deserve death because they desire it.

**Socrates**: They don't understand what kind of death a true philosopher deserves. Let's discuss this among ourselves. Do we believe in death?

**Simmias**: Yes.

**Socrates**: Isn't death the separation of soul and body? When the soul exists by itself, that's death.

**Simmias**: Yes.

**Socrates**: Should a philosopher care about bodily pleasures like eating, drinking, or love?

**Simmias**: No.

**Socrates**: Should he care about fancy clothes or other bodily adornments?

**Simmias**: No, he should despise them.

**Socrates**: A philosopher focuses on the soul, not the body. He tries to separate the soul from the body.

**Simmias**: True.

**Socrates**: Most people think life isn't worth living without bodily pleasures. They think someone indifferent to them is as good as dead.

**Simmias**: True.

**Socrates**: Does the body help or hinder the acquisition of knowledge? Are sight and hearing accurate?

**Simmias**: No, they are inaccurate.

**Socrates**: The soul attains truth when it is free from the body. True existence is revealed in thought, not through bodily senses.

**Simmias**: Yes.

**Socrates**: Philosophers dishonor the body and seek to be alone with the soul. Is there absolute justice, beauty, and good?

**Simmias**: Yes.

**Socrates**: Have you ever seen them with your eyes or any other bodily sense?

**Simmias**: No.

**Socrates**: The purest knowledge comes from the mind alone, without the interference of bodily senses. The body distracts the soul from acquiring truth and knowledge.

**Simmias**: True.

**Socrates**: Real philosophers understand that while the soul is in the body, it can't fully attain truth. The body causes endless trouble and distracts us from true being. Wars, fights, and factions come from the body's desires.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: Wars happen because people love money, and money is needed for the body. These distractions keep us from philosophy. Even when we have time, the body interrupts and confuses us, preventing us from seeing the truth. Experience shows that to gain pure knowledge, we must be free from the body. The soul must see things by itself. We can only attain wisdom after death, when the soul is separate from the body. In life, we get closest to knowledge when we interact with the body as little as possible and keep ourselves pure until God releases us. Then, we can be pure and understand the truth. The impure can't approach the pure. True lovers of knowledge talk and think about these things.

**Simmias**: I agree, Socrates.

**Socrates**: If this is true, there's hope that when I die, I'll achieve what I've pursued all my life. That's why I'm happy to go, and so should anyone who believes their mind is ready and purified.

**Simmias**: Certainly.

**Socrates**: Purification is the separation of the soul from the body. The soul gathers itself and lives alone, free from the body's chains.

**Simmias**: Very true.

**Socrates**: This separation is called death. True philosophers always seek to release the soul from the body. Their study is the separation and release of the soul.

**Simmias**: That is true.

**Socrates**: It would be contradictory for philosophers to practice dying and then fear death when it comes. True philosophers are always practicing dying, so they shouldn't fear death. If they've been enemies of the body and want to be alone with the soul, they should rejoice when this desire is granted. Many people are willing to die to see loved ones in the afterlife. A true lover of wisdom, who believes he can only enjoy wisdom fully in the afterlife, should also rejoice at death.

**Simmias**: Surely, if he is a true philosopher.

**Socrates**: If someone fears death, it shows they are not a lover of wisdom but of the body, money, or power.

**Simmias**: Quite so.

**Socrates**: Courage is a quality of philosophers. Temperance, which is control over passions, belongs to those who despise the body and live in philosophy.

**Simmias**: Most assuredly.

**Socrates**: The courage and temperance of others are contradictions. They face death out of fear of greater evils, and they are temperate because they fear losing pleasures. True virtue is exchanged for wisdom, not for other fears or pleasures. True virtue is the companion of wisdom, and without wisdom, other virtues are just shadows. The founders of the mysteries were right: those who are uninitiated will suffer in the afterlife, but those who are purified will dwell with the gods.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: In the mysteries, they say many carry the thyrsus, but few are true mystics. I interpret this to mean true philosophers. I've spent my life trying to be one of them. Whether I've succeeded or not, I'll soon know when I reach the other world. That's why I'm not sad about leaving you, Simmias and Cebes. I believe I'll find good friends and masters in the next world too. Most people don't believe this, but if I can convince you better than I did the Athenian judges, that will be good.

**Cebes**: I agree with most of what you say, Socrates. But people fear that the soul might disappear like smoke when it leaves the body. If the soul could stay together after leaving the body, there would be hope. But it takes a lot of argument and proof to show that the soul exists and has intelligence after death.

**Socrates**: True, Cebes. Shall we discuss the probabilities of these things?

**Cebes**: I'd like to hear your opinion.

**Socrates**: Let's consider whether souls exist in the world below. There's an ancient belief that souls go to the other world and return to be born again. If the living come from the dead, then souls must exist in the other world. Otherwise, how could they be born again? This would be conclusive if we had evidence that the living come only from the dead. But if not, we need other arguments.

**Cebes**: Very true.

**Socrates**: Let's consider this for all things, not just humans. Aren't all things with opposites generated from their opposites? For example, good from evil, just from unjust. Everything that becomes greater must have been less before, and vice versa. The weaker comes from the stronger, the swifter from the slower. This is true for all opposites.

**Cebes**: Yes.

**Socrates**: There are also intermediate processes, like increase and decrease, division and composition, cooling and heating. These processes involve a passage from one opposite to the other.

**Cebes**: Very true.

**Socrates**: Isn't there an opposite of life, like sleep is the opposite of waking?

**Cebes**: Yes, death is the opposite of life.

**Socrates**: These opposites are generated from each other. Out of sleeping comes waking, and out of waking comes sleeping. The process of generation is falling asleep and waking up. Do you agree?

**Cebes**: I agree.

**Socrates**: Now, analyze life and death in the same way. Isn't death opposed to life?

**Cebes**: Yes.

**Socrates**: What is generated from the living?

**Cebes**: The dead.

**Socrates**: And what from the dead?

**Cebes**: The living.

**Socrates**: So, the living are generated from the dead. This means our souls exist in the world below. The act of dying is visible, so there must be a corresponding process of generation, which is return to life. This shows that the living come from the dead, proving that souls of the dead exist somewhere and come back to life.

**Cebes**: Yes, Socrates, this conclusion follows from our previous admissions.

**Socrates**: If generation were in a straight line without a return, everything would eventually have the same form and state, and there would be no more generation. For example, if there were no alternation of sleeping and waking, everything would be asleep, and the story of Endymion would have no meaning. Similarly, if all things that partake of life died and didn't come back to life, everything would eventually die, and nothing would be alive.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: If the living come from other things and those things die, then everything would eventually be swallowed up by death.

**Cebes**: There's no escape from this, Socrates. Your argument seems absolutely true to me.

**Socrates**: Yes, Cebes, it must be so. We haven't been mistaken in our admissions. I'm confident that living beings come from the dead, and that the souls of the dead exist. Good souls have a better fate than evil ones.

**Cebes**: Your favorite idea, Socrates, that knowledge is recollection, implies that we must have learned things before our current life. This suggests our soul existed before we were born, proving its immortality.

**Simmias**: What arguments support this idea of recollection? I'm not sure I remember them.

**Cebes**: One proof is that if you ask someone a question the right way, they can answer correctly, showing they already have knowledge and reason within them. This is clear when they are shown a diagram or something similar.

**Socrates**: If you're still doubtful, Simmias, let's look at it another way. Do you agree that what a person recollects, they must have known before?

**Simmias**: Yes, that's true.

**Socrates**: When someone sees or hears something and then thinks of something else related to it, that's recollection. For example, recognizing a lyre might make a lover think of the person who owns it. This is recollection. Seeing Simmias might make someone remember Cebes. Recollection often involves recovering forgotten knowledge.

**Simmias**: Very true.

**Socrates**: From seeing a picture of a horse or a lyre, you might remember a person. The recollection can come from things that are either similar or different.

**Simmias**: Yes.

**Socrates**: When recollection comes from similar things, we consider whether the likeness falls short of what is recollected. Do you agree?

**Simmias**: Yes.

**Socrates**: Let's affirm that there is such a thing as absolute equality, beyond just comparing pieces of wood or stone. Do we know the nature of this absolute essence?

**Simmias**: Yes, we do.

**Socrates**: We obtained this knowledge by seeing material equalities and understanding the idea of equality, which is different from them. Material things can appear equal or unequal at different times, but real equals are never unequal. From these material equals, we conceived the idea of absolute equality.

**Simmias**: Very true.

**Socrates**: This means we must have known equality before we saw material equals. We recognize that all sensible things aim at absolute equality but fall short. This knowledge must have been acquired before we were born.

**Simmias**: Yes, that's true.

**Socrates**: If we acquired this knowledge before birth, then we also knew other ideas like beauty, goodness, justice, and holiness before birth. We must have had this knowledge before we were born.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: If we acquired knowledge before birth and didn't forget it, we would always have knowledge. Forgetting is losing knowledge, right?

**Simmias**: Yes, that's true.

**Socrates**: If we lost this knowledge at birth but later recovered it through our senses, then learning is really just recollecting what we already knew. When we perceive something, we can recall something else associated with it that we had forgotten. So, either we had this knowledge at birth and retained it, or we recollect it after birth.

**Simmias**: Yes, that's true.

**Socrates**: Which do you prefer, Simmias? Did we have the knowledge at birth, or did we recollect it from before birth?

**Simmias**: I can't decide right now.

**Socrates**: Can someone with knowledge explain it?

**Simmias**: Yes, they can.

**Socrates**: But not everyone can explain these matters, right?

**Simmias**: True, not everyone knows these things. They are recollecting what they learned before.

**Socrates**: When did our souls acquire this knowledge? Not since we were born, right?

**Simmias**: Yes, before we were born.

**Socrates**: So, our souls must have existed without bodies before they were in human form and had intelligence.

**Simmias**: Unless these notions were given to us at birth, but we lose them immediately, which doesn't make sense.

**Socrates**: If there is absolute beauty, goodness, and essence, and we compare our sensations to these pre-existing ideas, then our souls must have existed before birth. If not, the argument fails.

**Simmias**: Yes, Socrates, I agree. The existence of the soul before birth is tied to the existence of these absolute ideas.

**Socrates**: Is Cebes convinced too?

**Simmias**: I think so. But the idea that the soul continues to exist after death is not yet proven.

**Socrates**: If the soul existed before birth and is born from death, it must continue to exist after death to be born again. This proves the soul's immortality. But you and Simmias still have fears, like children afraid of the dark.

**Cebes**: Yes, Socrates, we need to be convinced not to fear death.

**Socrates**: Seek out wise people to help you overcome these fears. Now, let's return to our argument. We need to understand what can be scattered and what cannot. The compound can be dissolved, but the uncompounded is indissoluble and unchanging.

**Cebes**: I agree.

**Socrates**: Let's continue from here.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: Are the essences or true existences, like equality or beauty, subject to change, or are they always the same, unchanging forms?

**Cebes**: They must always be the same, Socrates.

**Socrates**: And what about things like beautiful men, horses, or garments? Are they unchanging or always changing?

**Cebes**: They are always changing.

**Socrates**: You can perceive these changing things with your senses, but the unchanging things can only be perceived with the mind. They are invisible.

**Cebes**: That is true.

**Socrates**: Let's suppose there are two kinds of existences: one seen and changing, the other unseen and unchanging.

**Cebes**: Let's suppose that.

**Socrates**: The seen is changing, and the unseen is unchanging. Our body belongs to the seen, and our soul to the unseen.

**Cebes**: Yes, the body is seen, and the soul is unseen.

**Socrates**: When the soul uses the body to perceive, it is dragged into the changing world and becomes confused. But when the soul reflects on itself, it enters the unchanging world of purity and wisdom.

**Cebes**: That is well said, Socrates.

**Socrates**: The soul is more like the unchanging, and the body is more like the changing. When the soul and body are united, the soul rules and the body serves. The divine rules, and the mortal serves. The soul resembles the divine, and the body resembles the mortal.

**Cebes**: That cannot be denied.

**Socrates**: After death, the body decomposes, but the soul, being invisible and pure, goes to the invisible and pure world of Hades. A pure soul, which has avoided bodily desires and practiced philosophy, will be secure and dwell with the gods.

**Cebes**: Yes, beyond a doubt.

**Socrates**: But a soul that is polluted and attached to bodily desires will not depart pure. It will be weighed down by the corporeal and remain in the visible world, afraid of the invisible.

**Cebes**: Very true.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: It's likely that the souls of the evil, not the good, are the ones wandering around graveyards. They are paying for their past lives and will eventually be imprisoned in another body, similar to their previous one.

**Cebes**: What do you mean by similar natures?

**Socrates**: Those who lived lives of gluttony and drunkenness might become animals like donkeys. Those who were unjust and violent might become wolves or hawks.

**Cebes**: That seems very probable.

**Socrates**: It's easy to assign places to souls based on their past lives. The happiest souls are those who practiced virtues like temperance and justice, even without philosophy. They might become social creatures like bees or ants, or return as just humans.

**Cebes**: Very likely.

**Socrates**: Only those who have studied philosophy and are pure at death can join the gods. True philosophers abstain from bodily desires, not out of fear of poverty or disgrace, but because they care for their souls.

**Cebes**: That makes sense.

**Socrates**: Philosophers know that the soul is trapped in the body and can only see true existence through philosophy. Philosophy helps the soul detach from the body and trust in its own understanding of pure existence. The soul of a true philosopher avoids pleasures and pains, knowing they bind the soul to the body.

**Cebes**: Very true.

**Socrates**: Intense pleasures and pains make the soul believe the body's perceptions are true, binding it further to the body. This prevents the soul from being pure at death and joining the divine.

**Cebes**: Most true, Socrates.

**Socrates**: This is why true philosophers are temperate and brave. They don't seek release from the body to fall back into bodily pleasures. They follow reason and contemplate the divine, hoping to be free from human ills after death.

**Simmias and Cebes**: We understand, Socrates.

**Socrates**: Don't fear that a soul nurtured by philosophy will be scattered after death. It will remain intact and join the divine.

After Socrates finished speaking, there was a long silence as everyone reflected on his words. Socrates then asked if there were any doubts or points needing further discussion.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: If you have doubts, please share them. Let's discuss and find better answers together. If I can help, let me know.

**Simmias**: We do have doubts, Socrates. We were hesitant to ask because we didn't want to trouble you at this time.

**Socrates**: Don't worry, Simmias. I'm not worse off now than at any other time. Like swans that sing joyfully before they die, I too am not afraid of death. Swans are sacred to Apollo and have the gift of prophecy, so they rejoice in their final moments. I believe I have a similar gift and will leave life cheerfully. So, ask your questions freely.

**Simmias**: Thank you, Socrates. My difficulty is that it's hard to be certain about these questions in this life. We should try to discover the truth or hold on to the best human theories if we can't find divine guidance. I feel the argument about the soul is not sufficient.

**Socrates**: I understand. What part of the argument do you find insufficient?

**Simmias**: Suppose someone argues that harmony in a lyre is invisible, perfect, and divine, while the lyre and strings are material and mortal. If the lyre is broken, the harmony should still exist, as it is divine. Similarly, the soul is seen as the harmony of the body's elements. If the body is damaged, the soul, like harmony, should perish. How do we answer this?

**Socrates**: Simmias has a point. Let's hear what Cebes has to say before we respond.

**Cebes**: My issue is different. I agree the soul is stronger and more lasting than the body. But the argument that the soul exists after death is still unproven. Consider an old weaver who outlives many coats he made. When he dies, the last coat remains, but that doesn't prove the weaver is still alive. Similarly, the soul might outlast the body but still perish eventually.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Cebes**: The relationship between the body and the soul can be compared to a weaver and his coats. The soul outlasts many bodies, just as a weaver outlasts many coats. But eventually, the soul might wear out and perish, just as the weaver eventually dies. This makes me doubt the soul's immortality.

**Echecrates**: I understand your doubts, Phaedo. Socrates' argument was very convincing, but now it seems less certain. How did Socrates respond? Did he share your concerns or answer them calmly and effectively?

**Phaedo**: Socrates responded with his usual calm and wisdom. He compared himself to a swan, which sings joyfully before it dies because it knows it is going to a better place. He encouraged us to ask our questions and not to fear troubling him.

**Simmias**: It's hard to be certain about these questions in this life. We should try to discover the truth or hold on to the best human theories if we can't find divine guidance. I feel the argument about the soul is not sufficient.

Similarly, the soul might outlast the body but still perish eventually.

**Socrates**: We must avoid becoming misologists, or haters of reason, just as we avoid becoming misanthropists, or haters of people. Both arise from ignorance and disappointment. We must recognize that few people and few arguments are entirely good or bad; most are somewhere in between. We should not lose faith in reasoning because of a few bad arguments.

Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: It's sad if someone finds an argument that seems true but later turns out to be false, and then blames all arguments instead of their own lack of understanding. They might end up hating and distrusting all reasoning, losing the chance to find truth.

**Phaedo**: Yes, that's very sad.

**Socrates**: We must be careful not to let this happen to us. We should strive to improve our understanding and gain mental health. Right now, I feel like a partisan, not a philosopher. A partisan cares only about winning an argument, while I care about finding the truth for myself. If what I say is true, then it's good to believe it. If not, my ignorance will die with me, and no harm will be done. So, let's focus on the truth, not on me. Agree with me if I'm right, or challenge me if I'm wrong.

**Socrates**: Simmias, you worry that the soul, though divine, might perish first because it is like harmony in a lyre. Cebes, you think the soul is more lasting than the body but might eventually wear out after many bodies. Are these your concerns?

**Simmias and Cebes**: Yes.

**Socrates**: Do you reject the whole argument or just parts of it?

**Simmias and Cebes**: Just parts.

**Socrates**: What about the idea that knowledge is recollection, implying the soul existed before the body?

**Cebes**: That part convinced me completely.

**Simmias**: I agree. I can't imagine thinking otherwise.

**Socrates**: But if the soul is a harmony, it can't exist before the body, as harmony comes from the lyre and strings. Harmony is made last and perishes first. This contradicts the idea that the soul existed before the body.

**Simmias**: True, there's no harmony in saying both that knowledge is recollection and that the soul is a harmony. I trust the first idea more because it has been proven, while the second is just plausible.

**Socrates**: A harmony depends on the elements that compose it and can't have qualities opposed to its parts. Harmony can vary in degree, but the soul doesn't. One soul isn't more or less a soul than another. Souls can be good or evil, but harmony can't explain this. Those who say the soul is a harmony must explain how virtue and vice fit into this idea.

**Simmias**: I suppose they would say that a virtuous soul has another harmony within it, while a vicious soul does not.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: We've agreed that no soul is more or less a soul than another, just as harmony is not more or less harmony. Therefore, one soul cannot have more or less harmony or discord than another. If the soul were a harmony, it would have no vice, because harmony cannot contain discord. This would mean all souls are equally good, which is clearly not true.

**Simmias**: I agree, Socrates.

**Socrates**: The soul often opposes the body's desires, like when it resists drinking when the body is thirsty. If the soul were a harmony, it would follow the body's states, not oppose them. But we see the soul leading and controlling the body, which contradicts the idea that the soul is a harmony.

**Simmias**: True, Socrates.

**Socrates**: So, we can't say the soul is a harmony. Now, Cebes, you want proof that the soul is immortal and imperishable. You think that even if the soul is long-lived and existed before birth, it might still perish eventually. This fear remains unless we can prove the soul's immortality.

**Cebes**: Yes, that's my concern.

**Socrates**: You're raising a big question about the nature of generation and corruption. Let me share my experience. When I was young, I wanted to understand the causes of things. I wondered if growth was due to the interaction of hot and cold, or if the brain was the source of perception and memory. But I realized I was incapable of these inquiries. I even forgot basic truths, like how eating and drinking lead to growth. 

**Cebes**: That seems reasonable.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: Let me tell you more. I used to think I understood concepts like greater and less. For example, I thought a tall man was taller than a short man by a head, or that ten is two more than eight. But now, I realize I don't understand the cause of these things. I can't explain why adding one to one makes two or why dividing one makes two. I have a confused notion of a new method and can't accept the old one.

Then I read Anaxagoras, who said that mind is the cause of everything. I was delighted and thought that if mind arranges everything, it must do so for the best. I expected Anaxagoras to explain why the earth is flat or round, why the sun and moon move as they do, and why everything is arranged for the best. But I was disappointed. He abandoned mind and used air, ether, and water to explain things.

It's like someone saying that my actions are caused by my bones and muscles, without mentioning the true cause: my decision to stay and face my sentence. This confusion of causes and conditions is common. People mistake conditions for causes, like saying bones and muscles cause my actions instead of my choice.

I wanted to understand the best cause, but I couldn't find it. So, I turned to the world of mind to seek the truth. I was careful not to lose the eye of my soul, like people protect their eyes during an eclipse by looking at reflections. I sought truth through thought, not senses.

**Cebes**: That makes sense, Socrates.

Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: I adopted a method where I assumed a principle I judged to be the strongest and considered anything that agreed with it to be true. Anything that disagreed, I regarded as untrue. Let me explain more clearly.

**Cebes**: Please do.

**Socrates**: I believe in absolute concepts like beauty, goodness, and greatness. If you grant me this, I can show you the nature of the cause and prove the soul's immortality.

**Cebes**: I grant you this. Proceed.

**Socrates**: If something is beautiful, it is because it partakes in absolute beauty. The same goes for everything else. Do you agree?

**Cebes**: Yes, I agree.

**Socrates**: I don't understand other causes people suggest. I believe that things are beautiful because they participate in beauty. This is the safest answer I can give. Do you agree?

**Cebes**: Yes, I do.

**Socrates**: Similarly, greatness makes things great, and smallness makes things small. If someone says A is taller than B by a head, I would say A is greater by greatness, not by the head. This avoids absurd conclusions.

**Cebes**: Indeed, I would avoid such inferences.

**Socrates**: You would also avoid saying ten exceeds eight by two, but rather by number. The same goes for other measures. You would assert that things come into existence by participating in their essence, like duality for two and unity for one.

**Cebes**: Very true.

**Socrates**: You would not confuse principles and consequences in your reasoning. You would seek higher principles until you find the best one. Philosophers do this, unlike those who are satisfied with confusion.

**Simmias and Cebes**: What you say is true.

**Echecrates**: Socrates' reasoning is wonderfully clear.

**Phaedo**: After agreeing that ideas exist and things participate in them, Socrates said: When you say Simmias is greater than Socrates and less than Phaedo, you mean Simmias has greatness and smallness. Simmias is not great because he is Simmias, but because he has greatness compared to Socrates. Similarly, Phaedo is greater than Simmias because he has more greatness.

**Simmias**: True.

**Socrates**: Absolute greatness will never be both great and small. Greatness in us will never admit smallness. The greater will either retreat before the less or cease to exist. Opposites cannot become each other; they either pass away or perish in the change.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Cebes**: That's exactly what I think.

**Another Person**: Isn't this the opposite of what we said before, that opposites come from opposites? Now it seems we're denying that principle.

**Socrates**: Good point, but there's a difference. Before, we talked about opposites in concrete things. Now, we're discussing essential opposites, which never change into each other. Concrete things can have opposites, but essential opposites can't transform into one another.

**Socrates**: Cebes, are you troubled by this objection?

**Cebes**: No, but objections often disturb me.

**Socrates**: Let's agree that an opposite will never be opposed to itself.

**Cebes**: Agreed.

**Socrates**: Consider heat and cold. They are not the same as fire and snow. Heat is different from fire, and cold is different from snow. When heat approaches snow, the snow either retreats or perishes. Similarly, fire retreats or perishes when cold approaches.

**Cebes**: Very true.

**Socrates**: Some things are always associated with certain ideas. For example, the number three is always odd. Even though three is not the same as oddness, it always has oddness. Similarly, other numbers like five are odd, and two and four are even.

**Cebes**: Of course.

**Socrates**: Essential opposites exclude each other, and concrete things containing opposites also reject the idea opposed to what they contain. For example, the number three will never become even while remaining three. The number two is not opposed to three, but three will never admit evenness.

**Cebes**: Very true.

**Socrates**: Let's determine what these things are. Things possessed by the number three must be odd. The idea of evenness will never intrude on three. The odd principle gives three its oddness, and the even is opposed to the odd. Therefore, three has no part in the even.

**Cebes**: True.

**Socrates**: Not only do opposites reject each other, but also things that bring opposites reject the opposite of what they bring. For example, five will not admit the nature of the even, nor will ten, which is double of five, admit the odd.

**Cebes**: I agree.

**Socrates**: Now, let's begin again. If someone asks what makes the body hot, you should say fire, not heat. If someone asks why a body is diseased, say fever, not disease. Similarly, say the monad is the cause of odd numbers, not oddness.

**Cebes**: I understand.

**Socrates**: What makes the body alive?

**Cebes**: The soul.

**Socrates**: And is this always the case?

**Cebes**: Yes.

**Socrates**: The soul brings life to whatever it possesses. Is there an opposite to life?

**Cebes**: Yes, death.

**Socrates**: The soul will never receive the opposite of what it brings, which is life. So, the soul will never receive death.

**Cebes**: Impossible.

**Socrates**: What principle repels the even?

**Cebes**: The odd.

**Socrates**: And what principle repels the musical or the just?

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: What do we call the principle that doesn't admit death?

**Cebes**: The immortal.

**Socrates**: Does the soul admit death?

**Cebes**: No.

**Socrates**: Then the soul is immortal?

**Cebes**: Yes, it is.

**Socrates**: If the odd were imperishable, wouldn't three be imperishable too? If cold were imperishable, snow wouldn't melt when heat comes. Similarly, if the immortal is imperishable, the soul, when attacked by death, cannot perish. The soul will not admit death, just as three won't admit evenness, and fire won't admit cold.

**Cebes**: True.

**Socrates**: If the immortal is imperishable, the soul will be imperishable as well as immortal. If not, we need another proof of the soul's imperishability.

**Cebes**: No other proof is needed. If the immortal can perish, then nothing is imperishable.

**Socrates**: Everyone agrees that God and the essence of life are imperishable. So, if the soul is immortal, it must also be imperishable. When death attacks a man, the mortal part dies, but the immortal part remains safe.

**Cebes**: True.

**Socrates**: So, the soul is immortal and imperishable, and our souls will exist in another world.

**Cebes**: I'm convinced, Socrates. If Simmias or anyone else has objections, they should speak now.

**Simmias**: I have no more objections, but I still feel uncertain because of the greatness of the subject and the weakness of human understanding.

**Socrates**: That's well said. First principles should be carefully considered. If they are clear, we can follow the argument confidently. If the soul is immortal, we must take great care of her, not just for life but for eternity. Neglecting the soul is dangerous. If death were the end, the wicked would escape their evil. But since the soul is immortal, the only escape from evil is through virtue and wisdom. The soul takes nothing with her but her nurture and education, which greatly affect her journey to the afterlife.

After death, each soul is led to a place where the dead are gathered. After judgment, they pass into the world below, guided by a spirit. The wise and orderly soul follows a straight path, while the impure soul struggles and suffers. The earth has many wonderful regions, unlike what geographers describe.

**Simmias**: I've heard many descriptions of the earth. Which do you believe?

**Socrates**: If I had the skill of Glaucus, I would tell you. But even if I could prove my tale, my life might end before I finish. I'll describe the earth as I conceive it. I believe the earth is a round body in the center of the heavens, kept in place by the balance of the surrounding heaven and its own equilibrium.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: The earth, being in balance, stays in the center of the heavens and doesn't move. This is my first notion.

**Simmias**: That seems correct.

**Socrates**: I believe the earth is vast, and we only inhabit a small part of it, like ants around a marsh. There are many other places with inhabitants. The true earth is pure and situated in the pure heaven, which we call the ether. Our earth is just sediment in the hollows below. We mistakenly think we live on the surface, like a creature at the bottom of the sea thinking it is on the surface of the water.

**Simmias**: That makes sense.

**Socrates**: If someone could reach the surface of the air, they would see a world beyond, much purer and fairer than ours. Our world is corroded and imperfect, like things in the sea corroded by brine. The upper earth is beautiful, with bright colors and pure elements. Everything there is fairer than here, including trees, flowers, and stones. The stones are like our precious gems but even more beautiful because they are pure.

**Simmias**: That's a charming tale, Socrates.

**Socrates**: The upper earth has animals and men who live in the air as we live around the sea. Their seasons are perfect, so they have no disease and live longer. They have better senses and can converse with the gods. They see the sun, moon, and stars as they truly are. The earth has many regions with different depths and openings, connected by passages. There are streams of water, fire, and mud flowing through these passages, causing a see-saw motion. The largest chasm, called Tartarus, pierces through the whole earth, and the streams flow in and out of it.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: The streams flow in and out because the watery element has no bed or bottom, and it surges up and down, just like air in respiration. This movement creates powerful blasts. When the waters rush into the lower parts of the earth, they fill them up, and when they rush back, they fill the hollows here, forming seas, lakes, rivers, and springs. The water then re-enters the earth, making long or short circuits, and falls into Tartarus at different points.

There are four main rivers: Oceanus, which flows around the earth; Acheron, which flows into the Acherusian lake where souls go after death; Pyriphlegethon, a fiery river that forms a boiling lake; and the Stygian river, which forms the Lake Styx and flows into Tartarus. These rivers create a see-saw motion in the earth, moving up and down.

When the dead arrive at their destination, they are judged based on their lives. Those who lived neither well nor ill go to Acheron, where they are purified and absolved of their wrongs. The incurable souls, who committed terrible crimes, are hurled into Tartarus forever. Those who committed serious but not irremediable crimes are punished in Tartarus for a year, then cast out and must seek forgiveness from their victims. If forgiven, they are freed; if not, they return to Tartarus.

The pure souls, who lived holy lives, go to a pure home above and live without bodies in beautiful mansions. Seeing all this, we should strive for virtue and wisdom in this life. The soul is immortal, and we should comfort ourselves with this thought. We should adorn our souls with temperance, justice, courage, nobility, and truth, ready for the journey to the world below.

**Socrates**: Soon I must drink the poison, but first I will bathe to spare the women the trouble of washing my body after I am dead.

**Crito**: Do you have any commands for us, Socrates?

**Socrates**: Just take care of yourselves, as I have always told you. That is the best service you can render to me and mine.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions.
Sent by Copilot: Here's a modern language summary of the passage:

**Socrates**: If you don't care for yourselves and follow my teachings, no matter what you promise now, it won't help. 

**Crito**: We'll do our best. How should we bury you?

**Socrates**: Bury me any way you like, but make sure I don't run away. (Smiling) Crito thinks I'm the body he'll soon see, not the Socrates who has been talking. He asks how to bury me, even though I've explained that I'll go to the joys of the blessed after drinking the poison. My words haven't convinced him. So, be surety for me to him now, as he was surety for me at the trial. Promise him that I won't remain but will depart, so he won't grieve when he sees my body being buried. Tell him he's only burying my body, and do whatever is usual.

Socrates then went to bathe, followed by Crito. We stayed behind, thinking about the discussion and our sorrow, feeling like orphans losing a father. After his bath, Socrates' children and family came to see him. He gave them some directions and then returned to us. As sunset approached, the jailer came in and, with tears, told Socrates it was time to drink the poison. Socrates reassured him and asked for the cup.

**Crito**: The sun is still up. Others have taken the poison late and enjoyed more time with their loved ones. Don't hurry.

**Socrates**: They think they gain by the delay, but I don't. I won't gain anything by drinking the poison later. Please do as I say.

Crito signaled the servant, who brought the poison. Socrates asked how to proceed. The man told him to walk until his legs felt heavy, then lie down. Socrates took the cup, asked if he could make a libation, and was told there was only enough poison. He prayed for a prosperous journey to the other world and drank the poison cheerfully.

We couldn't control our sorrow anymore. I wept, thinking of my own loss. Crito and Apollodorus also cried loudly. Socrates remained calm and asked us to be quiet and patient. He walked until his legs failed, then lay down. The man checked his feet and legs, which became cold and stiff. Socrates said that when the poison reached his heart, it would be the end. His last words were: "Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; remember to pay the debt." Crito promised to pay it. Socrates' eyes were set, and Crito closed his eyes and mouth.

This was the end of our friend, the wisest, justest, and best man of his time.
