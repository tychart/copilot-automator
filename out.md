Sent by Copilot: Sure, I can help simplify this passage for you. Here's a sentence-by-sentence breakdown in modern, easy-to-understand language:

1. The most precise sciences are those that deal with the most basic principles; for example, arithmetic is more precise than geometry because it involves fewer principles.
2. The science that investigates causes is also very instructive because those who teach us explain the reasons behind things.
3. Understanding and knowledge pursued for their own sake are found most in the knowledge of what is most knowable.
4. Someone who seeks knowledge for the sake of knowing will choose the most true knowledge, which is the knowledge of what is most knowable.
5. The first principles and causes are the most knowable because all other things are known through them, not the other way around.
6. The science that knows the purpose of each thing is the most authoritative and more important than any supporting science.
7. This purpose is the good of that thing, and in general, the supreme good in all of nature.
8. Based on all the criteria we've mentioned, this science must be one that investigates first principles and causes, because the good, or the end, is one of the causes.
9. It's clear that this is not a science of production, even from the history of the earliest philosophers.
10. People began to philosophize out of wonder, first at obvious difficulties, then at greater matters like the phenomena of the moon, sun, stars, and the creation of the universe.
11. A person who is puzzled and wonders thinks they are ignorant, which is why even a lover of myths is in a sense a lover of wisdom, because myths are made of wonders.
12. Since they philosophized to escape ignorance, they were pursuing science to know, not for any practical end.
13. This is confirmed by the facts; such knowledge began to be sought when almost all the necessities of life and comforts were secured.
14. We do not seek this knowledge for any other advantage; like a free person who exists for their own sake, we pursue this as the only free science, for it exists for its own sake.
15. Therefore, possessing this knowledge might be seen as beyond human power, because human nature is often in bondage.
16. According to Simonides, 'God alone can have this privilege,' and it is unfitting for humans not to be content with the knowledge suited to them.
17. If there is truth in what poets say, and jealousy is natural to divine power, it would likely occur in this case, making those who excel in this knowledge unfortunate.
18. But divine power cannot be jealous, and no other science should be considered more honorable than this one.
19. The most divine science is also the most honorable, and this science alone is divine in two ways.
20. The science that God would most appropriately have is a divine science, and so is any science that deals with divine objects.
21. This science alone has both qualities: God is thought to be among the causes of all things and a first principle, and such a science is either only for God or God above all others.
22. All sciences are more necessary than this one, but none is better.
23. The acquisition of this science must end in something opposite to our original inquiries.
24. All men begin by wondering why things are as they are, like self-moving marionettes or the solstices or the incommensurability of the diagonal of a square with the side.
25. It seems wonderful to those who haven't seen the reason that there is something that cannot be measured even by the smallest unit.
26. But we must end in the opposite and better state, as when men learn the cause; nothing would surprise a geometer more than if the diagonal turned out to be commensurable.
27. We have stated the nature of the science we are searching for and the goal of our investigation.
28. We need to acquire knowledge of the original causes because we say we know each thing only when we recognize its first cause.
29. Causes are spoken of in four senses: the substance or essence, the matter or substratum, the source of change, and the purpose or good.
30. We have studied these causes in our work on nature, but let's also consider those who have philosophized about reality before us.
31. They too speak of certain principles and causes, and reviewing their views will benefit our inquiry.
32. Most early philosophers thought the principles of matter were the only principles of all things.
33. They believed that the substance from which all things come and into which they are resolved is the element and principle of things.
34. They thought nothing is generated or destroyed because this sort of entity is always conserved.
35. Just as Socrates remains the same person even when he becomes beautiful or musical, they believed nothing else comes to be or ceases to be.
36. There must be some entity from which all other things come to be, and it is conserved.
37. They did not all agree on the number and nature of these principles.
38. Thales, the founder of this type of philosophy, said the principle is water, perhaps because he saw that all things' nutriment is moist.
39. He thought heat is generated from the moist and kept alive by it, and that water is the origin of moist things.
40. Some think that even the ancient people who first framed accounts of the gods had a similar view of nature.
41. They made Ocean and Tethys the parents of creation and described the oath of the gods as being by water, which they called Styx.
42. The oldest things are the most honorable, and the most honorable thing is that by which one swears.

Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the passage:

1. It might be uncertain if this view about nature is ancient, but Thales is said to have believed this about the first cause.
2. Hippo is not considered among these thinkers because his ideas are not significant.
3. Anaximenes and Diogenes believe air is more fundamental than water, while Hippasus and Heraclitus think fire is the primary element.
4. Empedocles adds a fourth element, earth, to the three already mentioned, saying these elements always exist and only change in quantity.
5. Anaxagoras, who was older than Empedocles but started his philosophical work later, says there are infinite principles.
6. He believes things made of similar parts, like water or fire, are created and destroyed by coming together and separating, but they remain eternal in another sense.
7. From these ideas, one might think the only cause is the material cause.
8. As people advanced, they were forced to investigate further.
9. Even if all creation and destruction come from one or more elements, why does this happen and what is the cause?
10. The material itself does not cause change; for example, wood does not make itself into a bed, nor does bronze make itself into a statue.
11. Something else causes the change, which is the second cause, the beginning of movement.
12. Early thinkers who said the substratum was one were satisfied with their ideas.
13. Some who believed in one substratum said it and nature are unchangeable in all respects, not just in creation and destruction.
14. Those who said the universe was one did not find a cause for this, except maybe Parmenides, who suggested there are two causes.
15. Those who believed in multiple elements could state the second cause more easily, like those who believed in hot and cold or fire and earth.
16. They thought fire could move things, while water and earth had the opposite nature.
17. When these ideas were found inadequate, people were forced to look for another cause.
18. It is unlikely that fire or earth is the reason for the goodness and beauty in things.
19. One thinker said reason is present in nature, causing order and arrangement, which seemed more sensible than previous ideas.
20. Anaxagoras adopted these views, but Hermotimus might have expressed them earlier.
21. These thinkers believed there is a principle that causes beauty and movement.
22. Hesiod might have been the first to look for such a principle, or someone else who saw love or desire as a principle.
23. Parmenides also mentioned love as a principle in the creation of the universe.
24. Hesiod said chaos was created first, then earth, and then love, which implies a cause that moves and unites things.
25. Deciding the priority of these discoveries can be done later.
26. Since both good and bad things exist in nature, another thinker introduced friendship and strife as causes of these qualities.
27. Empedocles said friendship causes good things and strife causes bad things.
28. Empedocles mentioned good and bad as principles, with the good being the cause of all good things.
29. These thinkers understood two causes: matter and the source of movement, but not clearly.
30. Anaxagoras used reason as a last resort to explain the world, but otherwise attributed events to other causes.
31. Empedocles used the causes more but not consistently.
32. He sometimes said love separates things and strife brings them together.
33. When the universe is dissolved by strife, elements like fire come together, and when united by love, they separate again.
34. Empedocles introduced different and opposing sources of movement.
35. He was the first to speak of four material elements but treated them as two: fire and its opposite (earth, air, and water).
36. Leucippus and Democritus said the full and the empty are the elements, calling them being and non-being.
37. They believed the full and solid are being, and the empty is non-being, making these the material causes of things.

Sent by Copilot: Sure, here's a simplified, sentence-by-sentence summary of the passage:

1. Just as those who believe in one underlying substance think all things come from its modifications, these philosophers say differences in elements cause all other qualities.
2. They believe these differences are shape, order, and position.
3. They say reality is differentiated by rhythm (shape), inter-contact (order), and turning (position); for example, A differs from N in shape, AN from NA in order, and M from W in position.
4. These thinkers, like others, neglected the question of where or how movement belongs to things.
5. The inquiry into the two causes has been pushed this far by early philosophers.

6. The Pythagoreans, who were the first to study mathematics, thought its principles were the principles of all things.
7. They believed numbers were the first principles and saw many resemblances between numbers and things that exist and come into being.
8. They thought modifications of numbers represented concepts like justice, soul, reason, and opportunity.
9. They saw that musical scales could be expressed in numbers and believed all things were modeled on numbers.
10. They supposed the elements of numbers were the elements of all things and that the whole universe was a musical scale and a number.
11. They collected properties of numbers and scales that matched the heavens' attributes and filled gaps to make their theory coherent.
12. For example, they believed the number 10 was perfect and said there were ten heavenly bodies, inventing a "counter-earth" to make up the number.
13. These philosophers thought number was the principle of things, forming their modifications and permanent states.
14. They believed the elements of number were the even and the odd, with the latter being limited and the former unlimited.
15. They thought the One came from both even and odd, and number from the One, making the whole universe numbers.
16. Other members of this school said there were ten principles, arranged in pairs like limit and unlimited, odd and even, one and plurality, and so on.
17. Alcmaeon of Croton had similar ideas, saying most human affairs go in pairs, like white and black, sweet and bitter, good and bad.
18. The Pythagoreans specified how many and which contraries there were.
19. From these schools, we learn that contraries are the principles of things.
20. They did not clearly state how these principles fit into the causes we named, but they seemed to consider elements as matter.
21. They said substance is composed and shaped from these elements.
22. Some ancient thinkers said nature's elements were more than one, while others spoke of the universe as one entity.
23. These thinkers did not all agree on the excellence or conformity of their statements to nature's facts.
24. Their discussion is not relevant to our investigation of causes because they did not assume being as one and generate it from one as matter.
25. They spoke differently, adding change to generate the universe, while others said the universe is unchangeable.
26. Parmenides focused on what is one in definition, Melissus on what is one in matter.
27. Parmenides said it is limited, Melissus said it is unlimited.
28. Xenophanes, the first of these thinkers, did not clearly state his ideas but said the One is God.
29. We should neglect Xenophanes and Melissus for our inquiry, but Parmenides sometimes spoke insightfully.
30. Parmenides claimed that only the existent exists and nothing else, but he also posited two causes: hot (fire) and cold (earth).
31. From early philosophers, we learn that the first principle is corporeal, like water and fire, and some thought there was one principle, others more than one.
32. Some philosophers also posited a source of movement, either single or twofold.
33. Philosophers treated these subjects obscurely, but they used two kinds of cause, with some treating the source of movement as one and others as two.
34. The Pythagoreans said there are two principles and added that finitude and infinity are not attributes of other things.
