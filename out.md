Sent by Copilot: Sure, I can help with that! Hereâ€™s a modern and simplified version of Aristotle's text from Book II, Chapters I and II:

### Chapter I

1. Human excellence is of two types: intellectual and moral.
2. Intellectual excellence comes from teaching and needs experience and time.
3. Moral excellence comes from habit, which is why the Greek word for it is related to the word for habit.
4. Moral virtues are not in us by nature because things that are natural can't be changed by habit.
5. For example, a stone naturally falls down and can't be trained to go up.
6. Virtues are not in us by nature, but we have the potential to develop them through habit.
7. We first have the ability to do things by nature, and then we perform actions.
8. For example, we have senses like sight and hearing naturally, and then we use them.
9. But virtues come from doing actions first, like learning to build by building or play the harp by playing.
10. By doing just actions, we become just; by doing self-controlled actions, we become self-controlled; by doing brave actions, we become brave.
11. Lawmakers make people good by habituating them to good actions.
12. Virtues are created and destroyed by the same actions, just like arts.
13. Good and bad harp players are made by playing the harp well or badly.
14. The same goes for builders and other skills.
15. Virtues are developed by acting in certain ways in our relationships with others.
16. By facing danger and feeling fear or confidence, we become brave or cowardly.
17. By handling desires and anger, we become self-controlled or uncontrolled.
18. Habits are formed by actions, so we need to focus on doing the right actions.
19. How we are trained from childhood makes a big difference in our virtues.

### Chapter II

1. The goal of this treatise is not just to know what virtue is, but to become virtuous.
2. We need to consider how to perform actions because habits depend on them.
3. We should act according to right reason, which we will discuss later.
4. Moral actions can't be described exactly because they depend on the situation.
5. Just like health, moral actions don't have fixed rules and must be adapted to each case.
6. Excess and deficiency spoil virtues, just like they spoil health.
7. For example, too much or too little exercise or food harms health.
8. The same goes for virtues like self-control and courage.
9. Too much fear makes a coward; too little fear makes someone rash.
10. Too much indulgence makes someone uncontrolled; too little makes someone dull.
11. Virtues are maintained by the right balance, not by excess or deficiency.
12. The same actions that create virtues also maintain them.
13. For example, strength comes from eating well and exercising, and strong people can do these things best.
14. By abstaining from pleasures, we become self-controlled, and once we are, we can abstain better.
15. By facing fears, we become brave, and once we are, we can face fears better.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.
